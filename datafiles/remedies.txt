 2  Physiology
2.1  Immune system
* White blood cells
? Extremely fragile. They are vulnerable to just about everything from radiation and chemicals, including fumes, to toxins and free radicals, to antibiotics and many kinds of water treatments such as fluoridation and chlorination, to tobacco smoke and residues like tar, to bacteria, viruses, and mold, and, I firmly believe, to mushrooms and perhaps also some other foods when eaten in excess. When they die, whether due to toxic metals or some other cause, the dead cells can cause havoc, but for all intents and purposes, there is no functional immune system for those whose white blood cells have been wiped out by adversity. This is very easy to demonstrate in darkfield microscopy, but it is also easy for individuals to observe once they are tuned in to the phenomenon of death of white blood cells.
? White blood cells gorge themselves on toxic debris.
* Immune enhancers
? An immune builder as a substance that helps the body to create healthy white blood cells. Astragalus! However, when WBCs are so sick that they are ready to die, they need stronger herbs.
? Some "immune herbs" work by detoxifying the white blood cells and some by nurturing them. It's so logical. It makes perfect sense to anyone who has studied Ayurveda. Watery substances nourish, especially those that are demulcent. These are usually bland tasting but mucilaginous and therefore a bit slimy. Think oatmeal instead of amaranth or cornmeal. Think sticky rather than crumbly. Of course, any extreme is too extreme so some kinds of stickiness aggravate the problems whereas moist foods that are nourishing give strength not only to the patient but also to the white blood cells upon which we depend to handle a multitude of tasks.
* Plasma
? Blood cells swim in plasma and the nutrients to regenerate them have to be present in the plasma or the blood cells will not get better. So, healing begins in the plasma and huge improvements are possible in one day and even greater improvements can occur over longer periods of time. This is why juice fasting is so effective.
 3  Prevention (and healing) principles
3.1  Avoid EMFs
* Minimize cell phone use
* When using a cell phone, use speaker phone (or at least hold it a few inches from your ear). Even the manufacturers directions say to hold it at least a 1/2” from your ear! 
* Don't carry cell phone right next to your body in your pocket. Distance matters, a few inches away from you is better than in your packet. If you “have to have it in your pocket”, place it so that the back side faces out. However, this still affects your reproductive organs, just not as much.
* EMF fields affect your blood. Using darkfield microscopy, you can clearly see the clumping (stress) which the EMF fields cause
3.2  Avoid immune suppressing foods
* Foods that you are intolerant to—gluten and dairy being common examples. 
* Sugar
* Processed foods (no canned sodas)
* GMOs 
? The big 4 GMO products— cotton, corn, soy and canola, including their oils
? More and more GMO products are being brought to market every day. Shop at a market where you know the farms and know the source.
? Don't eat animals which have had GMO feed. Most animals should be grass fed.
* Alcohol 
3.3  Avoid toxins
* Filter your tap water for both drinking AND bathing. If you can only afford to do one, filtering your bathing water may be more important, as your skin absorbs contaminants. To remove the endocrine disrupting herbicide Atrazine, make sure your filter is certified to remove it.
* Switch over to organic toiletries, including shampoo, toothpaste, antiperspirants, and cosmetics. EWG’s Skin Deep database can help you find personal care products that are free of phthalates and other potentially dangerous chemicals. 
* Say no to vaccines (and their aluminum, formaldehyde, thimerosal, etc.)
* Replace your vinyl shower curtain with a fabric one.
* When buying new products such as furniture, mattresses, or carpet padding, ask what type of flame retardant it contains. Avoid items containing PBDEs, antimony, formaldehyde, boric acid, and other brominated chemicals. As you remove toxic items from in and around your home, replace them with those that contain naturally less flammable materials, such as leather, wool, cotton, and silk.
* Avoid stain- and water-resistant clothing, furniture and carpets to avoid perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs)
* Replace your non-stick pots and pans with ceramic or glass cookware.
3.4  Nature and sunshine 
* Humans were not meant to live entirely within four walls, devoid of the sensorial pleasures and beautiful landscapes of Earth.
* Sunshine supplies more than just vitamin D. It even helps with such things as hydrochloric acid production in the stomach. The more of your body you can have exposed, the better
* Try to avoid sunscreen (it's usually toxic and you want the sun's rays). However sunburns are bad.
3.5  Elimination
* Essential for health, especially when the body has toxins to get rid of
* See 6.12 Constipation p. 30
* There is a saying that in countries where the people have large bowel movements, they have small hospitals. In countries where the people have small bowel movements, they have large hospitals.
3.6  Emotional well-being and community
* Positive (realistic) thinking
* Appreciate the good things
* Being unhappy is an invitation to imbalance, which in turn starts a cascade...
* Our culture loves to stress. Stress can slowly erode our health and it has been implicated in many chronic diseases such as heart disease, adrenal fatigue, insomnia and more. 
* We are social creatures, and we need the support and connection of those around us.
3.7  Exercise 
* Strengthens the cardiovascular system (addressing the leading cause of death in the western world)
* Supports the immune system by increasing circulation and moving the lymphatic system. Our bodies were meant to move and regular exercise increases our physical and emotional well-being, as well. 
* Plus, when you are physically fit, you have more energy and the activities of life are easier.
3.8  Hydration
* Most people live in a state of dehydration
* Hydration, with water, helps eliminate toxins.
* Drink half your body weight in ounces of water each day. 
? Teas and other liquids do not count toward this goal.
? Black tea and coffee are dehydrating
* Drink water in frequent sips throughout the day instead of a large amounts a few times per day.
* Drinking water in daylight hours is more important than after the sun goes down.
* Hydration is always important, but especially on airplanes, at high elevations, and during times of heat, intense activity, detoxing, illness or stress. 
* If in doubt about the purity of the water, add oil of oregano. See 7.33 Oregano oil* p. 70
* See 6.15 Dehydration p. 32 
3.9  Hygienic practices
* Hand washing
? Add colloidal silver or essential oils to hand washing solutions.
? Continue to run away from the anti-bacterial soaps (they kill the good guys as well)
* Cleaning of surfaces
? Common surfaces can be cleaned with bleach/essential oils/colloidal silver.
? Clove oil is one of the best disinfectants. It is 33 times stronger than hospital disinfectants. This means that it can be diluted, down to 1–2% of a solution, and still be effective. However, the odor is intense so we can compare it to other oils that are not so intense, like thyme and lavender.
? UV lights used for toothbrush sterilization
* Also look into waste disposal including human and animal feces.

3.11  Diet and digestion
* Good health always starts in the gut (mouth, stomach, small and large intestine, bile ducts and gall bladder)
? Create peaceful meal times
? Sit while eating
? Give thanks for the gift of food
? Select easy to digest foods—copious amounts of bone broth (cures everything), WAPF superfoods, 
? Vitamins C, A, D and minerals (zinc, etc.)
? Heat foods—or at least serve at body temperature. Cold foods chill cells in the stomach lining and the digestive tract. This reduces and slows nutrient assimilation because the digestive fire is dampened
? Chew each bit of food 10–15 times
? Vegetables—eat a rainbow of colors
? Eat a variety of foods
? Allow at least three hours between eating and bedtime
* Optimize your internal terrain—make it inhospitable to yeasts, fungus and parasites
? Get lots of sunshine
? Include lots of salt in your diet
* Combine foods properly—cheating a little is OK, except not when you have digestive problems
? Vegetables and healthy fats—the fat helps to absorb more of the minerals in the vegetables
? Protein and starchy carbohydrates should never be combined (meat and potatoes)
? A leafy green salad can be eaten with any protein, carbohydrate, or fat
? Fats inhibit the digestion of protein. If you must have a fat with a protein, eat a mixed vegetable salad. It will offset the inhibiting effect on digestion.
? Cod liver oil—take with the fattiest meal of the day
? Fruit—best eaten alone
? Liquids—drink minimal liquids (less than 8 oz.) with or immediately following a meal
? Milk—drink outside of regular meals
? Minerals, minerals, minerals (the real building block)
? Hard to get because of depleted soils
? Still found in sea products—but be careful because of pollution and toxins
* See 9.14 Probiotics* p. 90
* Lots of healthy fats—coconut oil, palm oil, animal fat, butter, ghee. If you only make one change, make this one. You will see results when you get healthy fats into your diets and then you will be motivated to make other changes.
* Basically nutrient dense foods (grains are not nutrient dense)
3.12  Posture
* Correct posture means better circulation which in turn means better health.
3.13  Prayer
3.14  Sleep
* Surveys show that anywhere from 20–40% of Americans are sleep-deprived on a regular basis. Not getting enough quality sleep is associated with heart disease, diabetes, fibromyalgia, injuries, declining personal relationships and a decreased quality of life through mental fogginess, feeling tired all the time, and so on. When we get deep restful sleep and wake up feeling restored and full of energy. We can think clearly and we can fully engage our lives with energy and vitality.
* Soak up the sunlight. During the day, that is...especially first thing in the morning. This will boost your ability to sleep at night (and boost your mood all day). So will daytime walk breaks in natural light.
* Avoid blue light for 1–2 hours before bedtime (e.g. computers and TVs). Blue light keeps you awake. 
* Obtain 100% darkness (for increased melatonin, which is recycled during the day into seratonin, the hormone of happiness).
* Consider timing. The body repairs and regenerates between 10:00 p.m.–6:00 a.m. (the liver performs several hundred essential tasks between 10:00 p.m.–1:00 a.m). Both Ayurveda and TCM philosophies say the sleeping hours around midnight are crucial for your body’s regenerative functions!
* Keep the temperature in your bedroom below 70 degrees F
* Avoid electromagnetic fields. See 6.22 Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) p. 34
 4  Healing principles
4.1  Act quickly
* The first few minutes makes a big difference when dealing with situations such as food poisoning 
* Often after the first 24 hours of a situation, your window of opportunity has greatly diminished
* If you suspect you have a problem, do your best to identify, then treat. If it turns out you didn’t really have a problem, it’s no big deal—these treatments are non-toxic
4.2  Be calm and think positive
* Calm breathing (diaphragmatic breathing)
? Helps you slow down your breathing when feeling stressed or anxious. Newborn babies naturally breathe this way, and singers, wind instrument players, and yoga practitioners use this type of breathing. 
? Sitting upright is usually better than lying down or slouching, because it can increase the capacity of your lungs to fill with air. It is best to 'take the weight' off your shoulders by supporting your arms on the side-arms of a chair, or on your lap. 
? Steps
1. Take a slow breath in through the nose, breathing into your lower belly (for about 4 seconds) 
2. Hold your breath for 1–2 seconds
3. Exhale slowly through the mouth (for about 4 seconds)
4. Wait a few seconds before taking another breath
? About 6–8 breathing cycles per minute is often helpful to decrease anxiety, but find your own comfortable breathing rhythm
* Bach Flower Essences Rescue Remedy. See  8.6.1 Rescue remedy* p. 81
4.3  Use multiple treatments
* Treat in multiple ways (e.g. for a rash—soak in charcoal water, apply charcoal topically, take charcoal internally, and increase your nutrition and water)
* Treating something in multiple synergistic ways is always best. You’re increasing your chances of success.
4.4  Remember convalescent phase
* After you think you're better, there is the convalescence phase where you rebuild your reserves. Western medicine does not recognize this phase, but traditional cultures all valued it.
* Continue to take it easy and consume bone broth and other nutritious food such as liver
* Minerals (and trace minerals)—are necessary for everything (foundational)
4.5  Seek medical help
* This might mean immediate medical treatment or simply talking to others you respect
* Get the best medical help for your condition (your health is priceless) —
? Western medicine (allopathic, pharmacological)
? Good for acute injuries such as a car accident, but not much else
? Suppresses symptoms to bring about comfort. If you simply suppress symptoms of a bigger problem, then that problem gets bigger and bigger and bigger and down the line you will have serious consequences.
? Provides some non-invasive/non-toxic tests which can be useful. Usually say no thank you to invasive and/or toxic tests
? Traditional medicine (acupuncture, herbalism, homeopathic, chiropractic, etc.)
? A different paradigm of thinking
? Addresses the root cause
? “Blended” doctors—someone claiming all modalities. Sometimes they don’t have the depth necessary
* Natural health is achieved through a thousand small health choices each day.
* Ask questions and do your own research
4.6  Stack treatments optimally
* Some therapies work synergistically—stack complementary therapies when you can to get the best results in the shortest time.
* Example—take sulfur first to get oxygen to the cells so they are open and more receptive, then half an hour later take something antimicrobial like oil of oregano. The oil will be better taken up by the cells thanks to the sulfur. Two hours later, take something like charcoal to adsorb toxins. (The waste products of bacteria and viruses are toxic and can overload the system. Also, when bacteria die, they release toxins and their dead bodies are considered foreign matter by the immune system, so using charcoal to draw these out frees up the immune system.)
4.7  Support your body so it can heal itself
* Be thankful you have them. Listen to them.
* Do not suppress symptoms, that only drives the problem deeper. A cosmetic skin issue—eczema—which is suppressed often turns into a deeper, more troublesome lung issue—asthma
* Your body will always do the best that it can with whatever it is given. Give your body what it needs. Often this means taking it easy, reducing stress, reducing EMFs and/or supporting the body at the cellular level (hydration, minerals, nutrients).
* Once you are “over the hump”, continue to take it easy for a bit. Your body is still working to get back its reserves.
4.8  Time treatments optimally
* Some things are best taken first thing in the morning (to rid your body of the toxins which were dumped overnight)—e.g. oil pulling (there is maximum bacteria in the mouth upon waking), a glass of warm water (hydrates you and gets things going)
* Some things are best taken near bedtime (to support your bodies detoxification process at night)—a detox bath (but leave an 1–2 hours to replenish water, minerals and electrolytes).
* Some things are to be taken without food— ½ hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal
? A detox bath (it requires all your bodies energy, it’s not good if your body is also working on digestion)
? Rejuvenation sleep (it requires your bodies energy, so you don’t eat 2–3 hours before bedtime)
? Anything you want to get in your system fast.
* Somethings are best taken without food, but will work either way.
? Oil or oregano
 5  Tools
5.1  Ayurveda
* https://www.youtube.com/user/BanyanBotanicals
* Local practitioners
? http://www.anandashala.com/ —Frederick, recommended by Banyon (can use their website to e-mail questions)
5.2  Bandaging
* Gauge pads vs. non-stick gauge pads
? Non-stick are great because when removing them you don't disturb the scab or any healing that has taken place
? The non-stick are not quite as absorbent and not quite as breathable
* Secure flex/elastic wrap 
? For firmly securing wound dressings, not as comfortable as the cotton wraps
? Coban, and the like, you can only use it a few times. Some say vet wrap is the same as Coban, only much cheaper.
* Ace 
? Great for compression and reusability
? More expensive and more tightly woven than elastic wrap
? Prefer velcro closures. Metal closures work, but are not as easy to use and sometimes come off.
* Sometimes in wound wrapping the gauze is used first, then secure gauze wrap, then an ace wrap for compression
* Sizing 
? 1”–2”—fingers
? 3”–4”—wrists and elbows
? 4”–6”—ankles and knees
? 4”–6”—trunk 
* Wrapping
? Start below the elbow and wrap up
? Overlap by ½ the wrapping width
? Have arm slightly bent when wrapping
* Supplies
? http://www.ithacasports.com
? 3” Wonderwrap (for reusability)
? 4” ACE-4INCHVELCRO (for absorability)
5.3  BioMat*
* Uses
? Circulation
? Driving castor oil, essential oil, etc, deeper
? Makes sprained ankles, etc. feel much better
* About
? The waterproof mini-mat cover does block some of the firm for red light wave but it also protects the BioMat from oil.
? If you put the castor oil pack on the knee,  still surround it with saran wrap (or wax paper) and then wrap it with a towel 
? Bath afterward (with soap) to remove toxic sweat
5.4  Breathing
* Mouth and nose breathing differ dramatically in terms of the depth of your breath, how the air is “prepared,” and the effects they produce in your body. Nasal breathing has a number of physiological advantages over mouth breathing.7 One important benefit is the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO is made by your nose and sinus mucous membranes, so when you breathe through your nose, you carry a small amount of this gas into your lungs.8, 9 NO is a potent bronchodilator and vasodilator, so it helps lower your blood pressure and significantly increases your lungs’ oxygen-absorbing capacity.10, 11, 12 NO also kills bacteria, viruses, and other germs. 
* Helps you go from sympathetic to parasympathetic mode
* It's good to learn a few exercises
* Keep you tongue on “the spot” (roof of your month)
* Buteyko breathing method
? If you tend to hyperventilate or breathe through your mouth during exercise, there are simple techniques you can learn to gradually transition yourself back into nose breathing. 
? Nose breathing will also help prevent the creation of an environment in your mouth that could promote caries and dental erosion.
5.5  Castor oil packs*
* Uses1
? Increase circulation and to promote elimination and healing of the tissues and organs underneath the skin
? Stimulate the liver, relieve pain, increase lymphatic circulation, reduce inflammation, and improve digestion
? Due to processes no one understands, castor oil has the ability to pull out toxins and renew the surrounding and underlying cells the pack is applied to.
* Directions
? Soak a piece of flannel in castor oil and placing it on the skin
? Cover the flannel with a sheet of plastic
? Place a hot water bottle over the plastic to heat the pack
? Leave in place for one hour
? Wash off afterwards with soap and water
? Often the protocol involves 3 nights on, 4 nights off
5.6  Cleanse
* http://www.muditainstitute.com/Blogs/Entries/2014/9/25_Liquid_Diet_Days.html
* http://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/cleansing/one-day-digestive-reset
5.6.1. Why do a cleanse
* Usher toxic residue out of the system
* Kindle the digestive fire
* Reset the metabolism
* Support healthy weight management
* Increase energy and vitality
* Rest and rejuvenate the body's tissues
* Balance and harmonize the doshas
* Improve clarity of thinking and memory
* Reduce generalized aches (that are not related to other health issues)
* Support healthy flow of prana
* Boost the body's natural ability to resist disease
5.6.2. When to do a cleanse
* Ayurveda traditionally recommends a cleansing at natural transition points, such as the change of seasons.
* A gentle home cleanse can be done at almost any time that suits your schedule, whenever you feel the need to reset your digestion and remove toxicity.
* If you are new to cleansing, you can start with a mini one-day cleanse one day per week.
* If you are ready to really experience the benefits of the home cleanse, commit to a 3-7 day process, following the same routine on a daily basis.
5.6.3. How to do a cleanse
* Mono diet
? Kitchari for breakfast, lunch and dinner
? See 9.9 Kitchari* p. 88 
? Sip hot water and hot detox tea
? See 7.23.1 Ginger tea* p. 68
? See 9.5 Cumin, Coriander and Fennel (CCF) Tea* p. 87
? Leave at least 5 hours between meals
* Self oil-massage
? See 5.8 Dry brushing and oil massage* p. 16
* Triphala
? See 7.45 Triphala* p. 73
5.6.4. Post-cleanse
* Gently and consciously reintroduce activities int your daily routine.
* Wait a few days to introduce heavier foods like dairy and meat.
* If you found portions of the cleanse beneficial, like the self-massage or Triphala, feel free to incorporate them into your long term daily routine.
* The days that follow a cleanse are a great time to start taking rejuvenating herbs and formulas like Ashwagandha and Chyavanprash.
5.7  Coffee enemas*
* Recommended sources
? Coffee—http://www.sawilsons.com
? Enema bucket—http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/product/enemaequipment.aspx
* Uses
? Removes toxins from the body
? Cleans the blood
? Detoxes the liver and colon and helps rebuild the liver
? Reduces many types of pain
* Recommend by
? Ralph Moss, PhD —"In general, coffee enemas are an important tool for physicians who try to detoxify the body...”
? Gerson Institute
? Nicholas Gonzolas
* Directions
? In a non-aluminum pot or saucepan: empty 4 cups of filtered or distilled water
3 rounded tablespoons of organic coffee (finely ground), not instant
? Stir the coffee to make sure all is mixed in the water, then bring to a boil and boil for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
? Reduce heat and cover pot or saucepan with lid and let simmer for 15–20 minutes.
? Remove from stove element and let coffee cool down to room temperature.
? Strain coffee through a fine sieve (Please avoid using a paper or cloth filter to strain your coffee as it removes much
more than the grounds, much of the prime elements such as Cafestol will be lost by
using cloth or paper.) to remove as many coffee grinds as possible.
? Because of the boiling process, some of the water may have evaporated, add
plain filtered water or distilled water to the coffee to bring it up to 4 full cups.
5.8  Dry brushing and oil massage*
* Quickly brush your whole body with a dry body brush made of natural bristles or a good natural loofah. 
? This will improve circulation, strengthen and rejuvenate the skin, and help with lymph drainage. 
? The brushing of the skin also opens the pores and increases the effectiveness of the oil massage, if applied afterward. 
? Start with the extremities, and always brush in the direction of the heart.
* Abyanga or oil massage
? Great video—https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HQLsfZh5js&list=PLRANToKAjU_BIhs2G-lAhC9sKMZg6wEOd
? Massage yourself with either sesame oil or coconut, sunflower or olive oil (all expeller or cold-pressed and unrefined, available from natural health food stores). 
? Abyanga helps draw out toxins and improves circulation. 
? Sesame oil, in particular, quickly penetrates all the layers of the skin, binds to and removes toxins of various kings (including harmful fatty acids) and helps rid the blood vessels of plaque.... 
? Abyanga also stimulates growth hormone production and improves immunity because nearly one third of the immune system is located in the skin. 
? Conclude the massage with a warm bath or shower. 
? Do the massage as often as is convenient for you. Some do it daily.
5.9  Essential oils
* Basics
? Very concentrated herbs
? Use only therapeutic2, don’t settle for the cheaper grades often sold in store
? Just like herbs, one-size does not fit all. Some oils work better for certain types of people.
? From Ingrid: The reality is that a single drop [of a pure essential oil] in water that is sipped over a day or two or even three days is actually medicinally significant but we do not actually know how this is possible. 
? Essential oils are very strong and must be diluted (usually in a carrier oil) or incorporated into a finished product such as a massage oil, lotion, or aroma spray. 
? Whether diluting an essential oil or adding it to a finished product, the oil content should only account for 1–2% of the total blend 
? 1 oz. = 30 ml. = 600 drops of oil. 2% of 600 drops is 12 drops
* Direct application
? Apply directly on area of concern, 1–6 drops. More is not necessarily better, since a large amount can trigger detoxification of the surrounding tissue and blood-stream
? Best areas for quick absorption—bottoms of feet (especially where the toes meet the foot) and along the spine in the back
? Other quick-absorbing areas include behind the ears and on the wrists
? When massaging a large area of the body, always dilute the oils by at least 15%–30%
? Do not mix oil blends—the chemical properties of the oils can be altered when mixed improperly
? Layering individual oils is preferred over mixing your own blends
? Apply one oil, rub it in, and then apply another oil. 
? There is not need to wait more than a couple of seconds between each oil as absorption occurs rapidly
? Moist heat—to drive the oils deeper
? Apply a hot wet towel and a dry towel on top of an already massaged area.
? Use Bio-mat
* Perfume or cologne—wearing the oils can provide emotional and physical support (in additional to the beautiful fragrance)3
* Inhalations
? Diffuser
? The easiest (and best) way of putting the oils into the air for inhalation
? By nebulizing the oils and misting them, certain pathogens in the air are neutralized. Likewise, by breathing some of the mist, the essential oils are introduced into the sinus passages and lungs so that these are exposed the oils. The nebulization allows some of the oils to reach the lower lobes of the lungs and some will, of course, go into circulation and thereby become a systemic treatment. I do not recommend being in the room with the diffuser for more than 3–5 minutes at a time. One should have one's head at six feet away from the diffuser.
? If you want to “stretch” an essential oil, you can use a less expensive oil such as lemon or sweet orange in combination with a more precious oil like cinnamon bark
? Types of diffusers4
* Cold air (best)—uses room-temperature air to blow the oil up against some kind of a nebulizer. 
? This breaks the oils up into a micro-fine mist that is then dispersed into the air, covering hundreds of square feet in seconds.
? The oils, with their oxygenating molecules, will then remain suspended for several hours to freshen and improve the quality of the airborne
? Ingrid's diffuser (Florihana model) must be operated with full strength essential oils, not diluted with water or carriers. It cannot be used for thick oils such as resins (myrrh and frankincense). The oils can be "stretched" using inexpensive oils, such as citrus oils, but even these oils will not make it safe to diffuse frankincense, myrrh, guaiac wood, or any other heavy oil.
* Heat source (such as a light bulb ring)—alters the chemical makeup of the oil and its therapeutic qualities
? Cloth or tissue
? Put 1–3 drops of a paper towel, cotton ball, handkerchief, etc.
? Hold it close to your face and inhale
? Hot water and steams
? Pour boiling water into a metal or glass bowl, and add a few drops of essential oil
? Drape a towel over your head and position your face 10–12 inches above the bowl and breathe in the steam.
? Vaporizer or humidifier
? Simply add a few drops when filling it with water
? Cold air types are best since heat reduces some of the benefits
? Fan or vent
? Put oil on a cotton ball and attach it to a ceiling fan or to an air vent
5.10  Grounding
* When you walk barefoot, free electrons are transferred from the earth into your body, and electrons are some of the most potent antioxidants known. 
* Grounding (also called Earthing) helps alleviate inflammation, as well as thinning your blood and causing your red blood cells to repel each other, making them less likely to clot.
* Be careful of grounding mats. Do not use them in the presence of electric fields. If you use them at night, turn the power off to the sleeping area and adjacent rooms (electric fields exist when the appliances are turned off, e.g. in the wires in the wall and leading up to the appliance switch) 
5.11  Heating compress
* Uses
? Stimulates the immune system, soothes stress
? Effective for menstrual cramps, pain, sore throat, pneumonia, and constipation
* Essentials
? A short treatment produces a tonic effect. A long treatment is used as a sedative, relaxing the muscles and associated blood vessels.
? Can be applied to any part of the body 
? Although the compress is applied cold, within about five minutes, it heats up from the reaction of the body against the cold. The heat produced is captured by a wool wrapper, and used to increase the temperature of the tissues (similar to a diver’s wetsuit)
* Steps
? Get 1–2 thicknesses of cotton or linen (to fit the affected area)
? Wet the cloth in water that is cold as you can take it.
? Quickly wring dry and apply cloth to place on the body.
? Over the wet cloth, place a piece of plastic large enough to cover the wet cotton with half an inch overlapping on all sides to seal the wet cloth.
? This in turn, is covered by a wool flannel cut to fit the area and large enough to cover both the cotton and plastic.
? In five minutes, this area of the body should be toasty warm.
? When the compress is removed, the treated part should be rubbed with cold water to “close the pores.”
5.12  Homeopathy
* Uses
? Infinite
? Remedies can be used stand-along or in combination with any other natural treatment modality. 
? Joette generally prefers homeopathy over herbs and essential oils. Sometimes she uses herbs and essential oils as they can be faster acting.
? Camellia 200C, you can uproot the actual cause of a sleeping problem (perhaps a teething issues). Where the tea just helps you calm down a bit. Homeopathy goes much deeper! 
? Homeopathy uses plants AND MINERALS.
? Usually you want something with similar symptoms, not exact. E.g. Rhus tox is exact.
* Essentials
? Homeopathic Online Education (HOE)-http://www.simillimum.com/index.php
? Homeopathy is a system of medicine that heals by “energy” rather than chemicals.
? Homeopathy is the most profound way of treating conditions. It will not only abort the present condition, but support the system so that the likelihood of it returning will be lessened. If it in fact it does return, it will be of a lesser severity.
? The more dilute the remedy, the stronger the action. 
? The spark the ignites the body to heal itself—kind of like a spark igniting a huge amount of gasoline. If you choose the wrong remedy, no harm, it just won’t work. 
? More effective (and immediate) when used immediately when the condition arises. It will still work if you wait too long, just not quite as well.
? Must match the remedy to the situation and the person. This isn’t always easy to do
? Cell salts
? Only 12 choices. Much easier for the beginner to master
? Joette Calabrese tells her kids to simply take BioPlasma (a combination of the 12 cell salts) at the first sign of an illness. Then when she is home to diagnose the situation, she will give a more tailored remedy 
? Trusted brands: Hyland’s, Washington Homeopathic (the best and can purchase in large quantities. Choose medium pellet size. The smallest size is too annoying and the largest size doesn't give you good value for your money), or Boiron
? Try not to touch tablets. Pour your dose from the bottle into the cap; from the cap, pour tablets under your tongue, where they will dissolve quickly.
? Once a tablet leaves the bottle, don’t put it back, as you might risk contaminating the remaining contents in the bottle.
* Dosing
? Dry dosing
? The general rule—4, 4, 4 (Take four tablets, four hours apart for four times). If you don’t see any improvement after this, you’ve chosen the wrong remedy. Really strong conditions resolve faster than milder conditions. For really strong conditions, you can dose significantly more often. 
? Take 15 minutes before or 1 hour after eating.
? Always take the exact dose. If you need more, then take the exact dose again.
? Wet dosing (preferred over dry dosing)... if you want to save money or make your remedy go further or don’t want to take pills... See http://hpathy.com/homeopathy-papers/questions-patients-ask-why-does-the-remedy-have-to-be-in-water/
? Prepare a dose in a mason jar with purified water. 
? Shake as many times as you can (about two minutes, hard), then keep closed and out of light. 
? When the jar is resting, just have it lightly covered (maybe a towel). It needs to breath so that the water stays oxygenated.
? Shake again before each dose.
? Take sips from it every few hours. 
? The prepared dose will keep for a weekend.
? If you expect a condition (exposure to something or symptoms, like cramps or jet-lag), take once an hour starting two hours before.
* To keep remedies effective for many years
? Avoid heat above 120 degrees, moisture and extended periods of sunlight.
? Best to store at room temperature in a drawer or box, not in the refrigerator. Joette likes to store her remedies in her linen closet.
* Antidoting (rendering ineffective)
? Pharmaceuticals antidote
? It is often said that strong odors such as mint, mint toothpaste, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, and oil of oregano can antidote homeopathic medicines. Also be careful of strong chemical odors and strong paint odors. The best rule of thumb is to be aware of the potential for antidoting, and if after being exposed to a strong odor, you notice a return of your symptoms, readminister the remedy and avoid exposure to the offending odor in the future. 
? Because the remedy’s stimulus is present in the body for at least 5 days after it has been taken, hold off from these antidoting substances for at least that long, so as not to interfere with the body’s healing process. Just rest assured, though. If you make a mistake, carry on with the schedule as though you weren’t exposed.

5.13  Hydrotherapy 
* For pain and discomfort 
* Increases circulation, which in turn helps cure.
* COLD Water STIMULATES and HOT Water RELAXES! Together, they are like a Hydrostatic Pump, that makes Blood FLOW! 
* HOT & COLD Water Therapy can bring about BETTER Circulation, because the HOT Water STIMULATES Blood Flow to the SURFACE of the Body, while the COLD Water STIMULATES Blood Flow to the CORE of the Body, thus bringing FRESH Blood to the Organs and Glands and ALL parts of the Body! In other words, OXYGEN & NUTRIENTS IN + TOXINS & PATHOGENS OUT!
* Instructions
1. 4 minutes HOT and 30 seconds COLD over the AFFECTED Area.
2. Work-up to doing about 4 repetitions of that sequence, ALWAYS ending with COLD Water.
3. Treatments can be done 2–3 times per day.
4. Sometimes, depending on the body part, soaks are feasible. Other times it is necessary to do hot and then cold water showers. Still other times, you may choose to use a shower wand.
5.14  Lymphatic massage
* Uses
? Stimulates the lymphatic system to improve metabolism
? Promotes the removal of bodily toxins and waste
? Encourages a healthy immune system
? Lifts energy
? Soothing of sore muscles
? Smoothing of cellulite
? Decreases facial puffiness
* For ear and sinus problems
? Grasp the lower part of the ear and begin stretching and massaging it. This helps any remedy you’ve taken reach the eardrum and begins to drain the lymph
? After a few minutes of massaging the ear, begin “milking” the ear lobe to increase drainage in the neck and throat. Place your finger in the indentation just under the ear and behind the jawbone. Gently stroke downward along the neck from this point. Gently massage the lymph nodes in the throat area, too. You’ll know what they are because you’ll feel hardened, lumpy areas in the neck and throat. These movements will dramatically increase the flow of lymph moving away from the ear. Garlic oil may be used for the massage. See 6.21 Earache p. 34
5.15  Magic needle*
* From Luke Tian
* In China for use the ear plugs for an hour/day. It's basically the poor man's doctor. The body will know what to do with the frequencies and heal the deepest condition first. Women often say using this device makes their face more beautiful. Tian's wife used the device for three months to cure her thyroid disorder.
* Wet the ear plugs before inserting them into your ear. Gradually turn up the frequencies to as high as you can stand them. After the hour, turn down the frequencies, then turn off the machine, then remove the ear plugs.
5.16  Medicinal teas and herbs
* Essentials
? How much tea to use when brewing
? Often for medicinal application you double the standard application
* With tea this means 2 T. instead of 1 T. per 8 oz. Cup
? If using fresh herbs, double the above amount
? Steep tightly covered for 20 minutes except aromatic herbs (see below)
? Drink at least 2 cups daily. For many blends, to see results requires 2 cups per day for an entire month
? Squeeze all the good liquid from the tea
? Do not add honey to bitter teas. Some of the medicinal value is in the bitterness
? Loose herbs are always more medicinal (potent) than tea bags
? A synergistic blend of herbs is always preferred to a single herb. A synergistic blend is more medicinal—the sum is much greater than it’s parts
* Decoction—If using plant roots, bark, twigs
? Soak overnight, if possible
? Simmer covered for 5 minutes the next day or simmer covered for 15–20 minutes if soaking wasn’t possible
* Infusion—If using plant leaves and flowers
? Pour boiling water over the herbs. Freshly boiled water (brought to the boil and boiled for 1–2 minutes) provides ions (over-boiled water destroys ions).
? Aromatic herbs (thyme, basil) steep for a few minutes. Other herbs can benefit from a much longer steep.
* Simple hot water—for detoxing, if herbs are not available
? Prepare a thermos of hot water, freshly boiled for 1–2 minutes and kept as hot as possible in a thermos. 
? Sip throughout the day, re-closing the thermos to maintain heat.
? Remember to drink water to rehydrate, because this will draw water and toxins out and is therefore dehydrating.
5.17  Misting*
* To disinfect. One suggestion is to mist your furnace filter with both colloidal silver and essential oils. Probably do it monthly; however, in time of illness, consider doing it weekly.
* Some hospitals have been employing an allegedly new "technology" involving misting with 35% hydrogen peroxide.
* Colloidal silver would have benefits similar to hydrogen peroxide; and it would potentially be better long-term because hydrogen peroxide would presumably dry quickly and have no long-term benefits. Silver would likely leave a fine residue with some longer-term benefits that are perhaps similar to those of essential oils except that I think essential oils can act much longer if the surfaces are not wiped down with something that removes the oils.
* Also silver and essential oils are not harsh on objects which they come in contact with.
5.18  Muscle testing
* Basic theory
* Uses
? Evaluate products for relative usefulness/harm
? Assess stresses from foods, supplements, medications, and environmental factors 
5.19  Neti Pot*
* http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/product/neti.aspx
* For general sinus health OR if you are troubled with nagging eye and head issues like tired eyes, eye discomfort, heavy headedness, headaches, irritability etc., using the neti pot along with the Ayur Ghee Nasal Drops will do wonders for overall nose, eye, ear AND brain health.
* For how to use, watch any of the internet videos— http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/product/neti_video.aspx
5.20  Oil pulling*
* Uses: detoxes the entire body—reducing toxic load, boosting other therapies. 
* Take a tablespoon of any oil (coconut, palm, olive, etc.), swish it in your mouth for 20 minutes, spit it out (do not swallow at any time during the swishing, the oil absorbs toxins). To reduce the chance of absorbing toxins, swish for 5 minutes, spit out, swish for another 5 minutes, spit out, etc...
* Increase the effectiveness by adding any of the following to your swishing oil. 
? Oil of oregano
? Clove oil may be used in cases of gum or tooth infection.5 6
? Activated charcoal
5.21  Poultices*
* A poultice is a soft moist paste of fresh or dried herbs (fresh is always best) mixed with a liquid and then applied directly on the skin to help with pain, infection, or inflammation. The word “poultice” comes from the Latin word pultes, meaning “porridge”, and this is a very accurate description of what a poultice looks like.
* It's important to break the cell wall of a plant with mashing (or chewing).
* Common liquid mixing materials
? Water
? Colloidal silver
? Spit (chew the leaves in your mouth)
? Apple cider vinegar
* Poultices work even better if the skin is more permeable, which happens after someone has been in a sauna, hot bath, in high humidity, or after a massage.
5.22  Rebounding*
* Uses
? Encourage lymph drainage (lymphatic fluid takes the toxic materials out of your cells)
? Strengthen immunity (white blood cells help you fight infections. Rebounding encourages the growth of white blood cells)
? Jump start your metabolism
? Detox your body
? Improve your digestion
? Relieve constipation
? Strengthen your cardiovascular system
? Increase blood flow 
* Receive these benefits from something as simple as the “health bounce”
* Best to do every few hours.
5.23  Soaks and baths
* A whole body bath is best; however, a simple foot bath has effects on the entire body. Sometimes a hand soak may be all that is necessary.
* Benefits
? Increased circulation (helps with everything)
? Can be used to draw toxins out or increase body temperature to stimulate healing
* Additions to water (non chlorinated water always preferred)
? Epsom salts (detoxes, promotes sleep, provides essential minerals such as sulfur to the body)
? Baking soda/Epsom salts (radiation)
? Salt (any type)
? See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81
? See 9.2 Clay* p. 84
? See 5.9 Essential oils p. 17
? Add cell salts (see cell salt combinations). Use about 20 tablets of each cell salt.
* Instructions for a bath
? Wait at least 2 hours after a meal before taking a medicinal bath. After a meal, your body is busy digesting food. It doesn’t have the resources to devote to detoxing in a bath. You are more likely to get dizzy.
? Drink water before, during and after soak!
? Dissolve ingredients completely in bath water. Water should be as hot as possible, but don’t burn yourself.
? Submerge and soak for as long as the water stays warm (about 20–30 minutes). Get as much of your body as possible under the water—kidneys, liver, etc. If you can’t get your liver under the water, soak a wash cloth and place it over your liver. 
? Don’t add more warm or hot water to the bath water if it cools. Drain water, rinse tub (to remove whatever the soak drew out). Repeat by drawing a second bath adding soda and salt.
? Rinse well after soak and relax.
? Replenish your body with electrolyes and minerals (clay will take them out)
? Sometimes a soak is following by a poultice or patch.
? Depending on condition and what you are using in your soak water, determines how often the soak is repeated. 
* Instruction for a foot soak (or any body part) 
? Follow directions for a bath (above), only use a small vessel (big enough for what you want to soak)
? A foot soak is almost as good as a full body bath—it’s the next best thing. 
? A foot soak is preferred to a full bath if the person is very weak (because it is gentler) 

5.24  Sun gazing
* An ancient practice that can induce healing of body and mind
* Sunlight enters and leaves the human body most easily and directly through the human eye, provided it isn't filtered out by colored lenses.
* Upon entering the pineal gland in the brain, the different rays are chemically encoded in the brain and passed on to the organs and systems in the body. The vital organs of the body are dependent on specific colors of the light spectrum. For kidney cells to function properly, for example, they require red light. Heart cells need yellow light, and liver cells require green light. Light deficiencies in any of the organs and systems on the body can lead to disease.
* Regular sun gazing can help restore balance and efficiency to all cells in the body.
* One should gaze at the sun only in the morning or evening hours, about 1–2 hours after sunrise or before sunset. Look at the rising or setting sun once per day.
* On the first day, look at the sun in a relaxed manner for a maximum of 10 seconds. On the second day, look at it for 20 seconds, adding about 10 seconds every succeeding day. After ten continuous days of sun gazing you will be looking at the sun for about 100 seconds. The eyes can blink or flicker and don't need to be steady.
* To receive the main benefits of sun gazing, you need to increase the duration in the above manner until you reach three months. This brings you up to the length of 15 minutes of gazing at a time. As the brain incrreasingly receives extra power through this pathway, you will find a drastic reduction of mental tension and worries. With fewer worries and fears, your brain brain may use the saved and additionally supplied energy for healing and improvement of mental and physical wellbeing. One of the most frequently reported benefits of regular sun-gazing is improvement of eyesight.
5.25  Trauma releasing exercises (TRE)
* Taught by Kim Thompson, developed by David Berceli
* For physical and emotional trauma
* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27VgK0LrR3Q
* A series of 7 exercises
? Exercise 6—wall sit
1. Make sure feet are further away from wall than knees. 
2. Press your back against the wall and slide down until thighs are roughly parallel to floor.
3. Remain here until quads reach a level 7 intensity.
4. Then slide up the wall a few inches and remain here until quads reach level 7.
5. Slide up the wall a few inches again and remain here until quads reach level 7.
6. Then stand up and hang in a forward bend for a minute, keeping your knees soft and allowing your head to hang.
? Exercise 7—frog
? Rest position: lie on back, soles of feet together, knees bent and turned out to the sides.
? Stop position: legs long on the ground, lock knees. The stop position will cause the tremors to begin to subside. You can do this at any time to stop the release.
1. Start of in rest position for 1 minute.
2. Then press outer edge of feet into floor to lift pelvis up in the air (any amount).
3. Remain here for 1 minute.
4. Return to rest position (pelvis back on floor) for 1 minute. (you may want to slide your feet a little bit away from the pelvis.)
5. Then bring knees 2 inches closer together and remain for 2 minutes.
6. Bring knees 2 inches closer again and remain for 2 minutes
7. Bring knees 2 inches closer once again and remain for 2 minutes.
8. Place soles for feet on the floor and keep knees slightly wider than the feet.
9. Allow your body to release however it would like to. (The pelvis remains on the floor for all of this exercise except for the one minute of lifting.)
10. To end the session, straighten your legs on the floor and lock your knees. You can rest for a few minutes lying on your back, on your side or on your belly. To get up, come to side-lying and use your hands to help push you up.
5.26  Urine therapy
* For all diseases (except those caused by traumatism or structural disorders) 
* See Andreas Mortiz
* "The Water of Life, A treatise on Urine Therapy," by John W. Armstrong
5.27  YogaToes*
* http://www.yogapro.com/
* Uses
? Helps relieve foot pain by spreading, stretching and exercising toes.
? Brings vital circulation to neglected lower extremities
? Realign toes and optimize foot posture
? Improve overall balance and agility
? Bunions, hammer toe, etc.
* While sitting or standing, do various micro movements with your feet and toes— http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qolTBXG7NNU
* Walking in YogaToes is not recommended
* At night try YogaToes to relax. Wake up refreshed ready for the day.
* If you don't think they make a difference, just wear them on one foot and compare.
 6  Problems
6.1  Acne
* Hepar sulph 200 twice daily for about 2 months.
6.2  Allergies—food, chemical, pet
* Food
? Pulse test
? Very reliable if you start with your resting pulse, first thing in the morning. Your resting pulse should be about 64. If you were exposed to EMFs throughout the night, you won’t have a resting pulse, you’ll be starting with an elevated pulse, and the reliability of the test goes down.
? Take your pulse to get a baseline, then eat something first thing in the morning, wait half an hour, take your pulse again. If pulse increases by more than 10–15 beats, you’re having an unfavorable reaction to that food. The more your pulse increases, the more unfavorable the reaction is.
? Put some of the food on your wrist at night before bed. Observe your wrist the following morning. If it is red or irritated, the food is not good for you at the current time.
? Notice how you feel. Do you get lots of mucus in your throat after consuming a certain food?
? Avoid issue until your gut flora has improved
* Other
? Possibilities include—fabric, laundry detergent, pets, molds, etc.
? Eliminate source and treat symptoms
6.3  Altitude sickness
* Drink more water
* Chew Coca leaves or drink tea made from Coca leaves
6.4  Bacterial infection 
6.4.1. Essentials
* A viral infection, if not treated properly can go into a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia 
* Preventative/treatment
? Vitamin C
? See 9.18 Sulfur* p. 91!
6.4.2. Strep
* Need to get rid of it before complications develop. 
* Use anti-biotic oils
* If using mainstream anti-biotics, you will need large amounts of high quality probiotics.
* Consider Belladonna
6.4.3. Bronchitis
* Begin by making sure the room is a comfortable 70 degrees because cold and especially cold damp weather are often the bane of bronchitis. It is a good idea to enforce bed rest. Bronchitis and all lung infections are not to be take n lightly. Plenty of water and homemade bone broths loaded with gelatin should be offered frequently. Freshly homemade squeezed orange/grapefruit juice is also valuable. And convalescence is key. Take as long as necessary to rest before resuming your duties.
6.5  Bites, stings
1.1.1. Essentials
* Prevention
? Wear long pants and long sleeves 
? Wear shoes and socks
? Tuck pants legs in socks 
? Wear light colored clothing
? Mosquitoes 
? Avoid mosquito-infected swamps and other damp areas
? Takes extra precautions when mosquitoes are most prevalent—dawn and dusk
? Sleep under mosquito netting
? Ticks
? Avoid tall grassy fields
? Organic sulfur
? Herbal bug repellent
* Treatment
? Wash itches away with soap and water—this removes reaction provoking substances.
? Apply charcoal, oregano oil, Shea butter, or lavender
? Homeopathy
? The protocol is to take Ledum 200 every 3 hours when the pain, swelling, etc. is severe and less frequently when signs of symptoms have been resolved. This could be within minutes, hours, days or weeks, depending on the nature of the bite, or your sensitivity to such.
? However, not all reactions to stings are alike. Occasionally, the site of the sting is hot and puffy in an edematous way. This would be a call for the remedy Apis mell instead of Ledum. Generally, Apis mell is the second choice, but if the site has a look as though the area is holding water, then Apis is the better remedy to begin with. If, after choosing a remedy that appears to be insufficiently addressing the problem, give the next best remedy. Do this after at least 3 doses have been tried.
1.1.2. Animals
* Most likely lay the victim down. You do not want the area of the injury higher then the heart
* Keep the bitten area still. You can immobilize the area with an improvised splint made from a board, magazines, or other stiff material tied to the limb. Don't tie it too tight—you don't want to reduce blood flow.
* Remove any jewelry or constricting items near the affected area in case of swelling. If the area has already swelled, something slippery like coconut oil is very helpful.
* Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.
* Homeopathy
? Hypericum perforatum 200c and Arsenicum 200c— take one dose of each within a few minutes of each other.
? “Under our system of the Banerji Protcols, and based on our long experience of treating various kinds of animal bites, particularly in Mihijam in India, where there were no other facilities for treating them, Stramonium 200c and Arsenicum album 200c, given four times a day for one month, we found to be of immense value in saving lives.”
1.1.3. Snakes, spiders
* Get medical help
* Then proceed as follows:
? Add charcoal (½ cup) to 2–5 gallons of water and soak for 30–60 minutes
? Prepare a charcoal poultices
? Cover the area with a large charcoal poultice
? Change every 10–15 minutes until the swelling and pain are gone.
? Give charcoal orally as well
? Attempt to identify the snake or remember its appearance in order to let the hospital or poison control what type of antivenom is needed.
* Do not
? Cut open the wound and try to suck out the venom
? Use ice to cool the bite
? Use a tourniquet. This will cut off blood flow and the limb may be lost.
1.1.4. Ticks
* Use tweezers to remove the tick as soon as possible. If you have a specialized tick remover device, that's even better.
* It's best to save the tick in a freezer bag in your freezer in case you develop symptoms. Sometimes it is helpful to know what was present in the tick.
* Wash and disinfect area after tick removal.
* Charcoal
? It couldn't hurt to apply a charcoal paste to help remove any toxins which may have entered the skin. 
? Be double sure and take charcoal internally as well.
* Homeopathy
? Step 1:
? Start with Ledum palustre 200C: This is taken every 3 hours for the first day, followed by twice daily for a week. This is then used twice weekly for a month and then once per week for another month.
? This is probably overkill, but worth the extra effort to be certain. 
? If the bite was rather recent (say a few weeks ago), this measure has been 100% effective so far in my experience. 
? Step 2
? If I thought that someone in my family had Lyme that was older and more entrenched, I’d still follow Step 1 and add Step 2 at any time after using Ledum. But I don’t believe Step 2 is necessary if the tick was discovered in the last few days or so.
? Aurum arsenicum 200, twice daily for one week and in the same manner as Ledum. 
1.2  Blisters
* All raised, fluid filled blisters are treated in exactly the same way. It doesn’t matter whether the blister was raised due to a burn, form breaking in new shoes, or from too much gardening with no gloves.
* Goals
? Remove pain
? Remove the fluid without breaking the blistering
? Leave no scar
* For best results, first soak blister in warm clay or charcoal water. See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24
* Apply clay or charcoal to blister and surrounding 2 inches of skin. (Best if clay or charcoal is mixed with colloidal silver instead of simple water.) Cover with plastic wrap. Leave it on until it begins to dry out, then wash off the old clay or charcoal and reapply new. See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81
? The pain should subside almost immediately
? All fluid should be gone in 12–24 hours
? Healing should be complete in 24–48 hours 
1.3  Boils
* Usually start as red, tender lumps. The lumps quickly fill with pus, growing larger and more painful until they rupture and drain. 
* See 7.16 Echinacea+ p. 66
* See 7.37 Plantain+ p. 71
* See 8.3.23 Silicea 30C* p. 80
1.4  Bunions
* Dddd
* Yoga toes help to dissolve calcium deposits
1.5  Burns 
* Immerse in cold water—or put under running cold water—for 15 minutes 
* Apply raw honey or aloe multiple times daily—or use clay or charcoal
* The easiest thing is probably to spray the area with colloidal silver.
* In Germany standard treatment is a charcoal poultice made with colloidal silver.
* Possibly test different spots with the various options above to determine what will work the best.
1.6  Cholesterol
* 7Every day for about one month, let six pieces of clove soak in half a glass of water overnight, remove the cloves in the mornings with a spoon or fork, and drink this water every day for about one month. This should help restore your cholesterol levels back to what is normal for your body.8
1.7  Cholesterol
* High LDL
? A cellular intelligence disorder, or more specifically, a metabolic disorder. (5)  It is believed to be a warning sign that your Agni (or digestive fire) is imbalanced.  This imbalance is usually caused by eating too many difficult-to-digest foods including: excessively sweet food, excessively heavy, cold or dry foods; processed food and stale food; poor food combinations and from other factors that can hamper Agni – such as high stress, no exercise etc. 
? In terms of Ayurvedic home remedies, fenugreek is great for reducing LDL cholesterol. 
? Soak 1/2 tsp of fenugreek seeds in water overnight. 
? In the morning add 1 tbsp of Aloe Juice and 1/4 tsp of turmeric and consume before breakfast.
? Garlic is also good for reducing cholesterol so use it regularly in your cooking (cooked garlic is best).
1.8  Constipation
* For health, you should have at least one bowel movement each day. Three is ideal—one after each meal. Babies start off that way
* Consider the squatting position which gives you more complete elimination. That’s how traditional cultures did it. 
* Drink a glass of warm water first thing in the morning to encourage removal of toxins from overnight cleansing and to jump start the digestive system. 
* Half an hour later, you could follow up with papaya, figs, prunes and other fruits. If you eat dehydrated fruits, you must hydrate the fruit first by soaking it in water for a few hours before eating it (overnight is better). 
* Exercise—simply walking and breathing deeply through the nose.
? Take 2 T. in ½ glass of water every 2 hours for 3 doses.
? Take 1 t. every 4 hours for the next 24 hours.
? Follow each charcoal dose with 2 glasses of water
* Have adequate water intake throughout the day. See 3.8 Hydration p. 9
* Consume lots of olive oil at all your meals.
* Eat 2–3 apples per day. Or apple cider really cleans you out.
* See 7.45 Triphala* p. 73
* Start introducing flaxseed gradually in to your diet, working your way up to 2 T. per day. Flaxseeds must be freshly ground. One method is chewing them thoroughly. Make sure to drink lots of water because flax absorbs water.
* Drink this healing tea if you have a lot of trapped gas. 
? Ingredients: fresh organic ginger root and anise, fennel and caraway seeds.
? Put a few thinly sliced pieces of ginger in water mixed with a level tablespoon of fennel, anise and caraway. 
? Boil for five minutes and drink this healing tea. 
? Ginger contains a carminative that protects the stomach. Ginger increases circulation so it helps effect a systemic cleansing through the bowels. Fennel treats indigestion, gas and spasms of the digestive tract and increases peristalsis. Caraway and anise are stimulants that reduce spasms in the gastrointestinal tract. 
* Peppermint also relieves symptoms—contains menthol which has an antispasmodic effect on the muscles of the digestive tract and helps dispel gas which often accompanies constipation 
* Honey is a natural laxative (also molasses)—dissolve in a glass of warm water and consume first thing in the morning
* Chamomile, bitters
* Probiotics
* Massage—lay on your back, massage your colon beginning with the ascending colon and ending with the descending colon, use light pressure
* See 5.5 Castor oil packs* p. 14
* See 9.8 Epsom salt* p. 88
1.9  Cough
* Try a 1 T. honey, buckwheat if possible
* Let’s understand how homeopathy treats coughs that aren’t accompanied by bronchitis. A cough that is loud, noisy and hard, like a barky croup that sounds like a seal, is a call for Kali mur 6X. Thick, whitish mucus accompanies the cough, and often the cervical lymph nodes are inflamed. 
* Kali sulph 6X on the other hand, is the remedy for when a good deal of mucus is rattling in the chest. Often this kind of cough is made worse by being in a warm, stuffy room and, conversely, is made more comfortable in cool open air. 
* Mag phos is the premiere remedy for a cough that’s spasmodic and often worse at night. This is of particular value in whooping cough, as it is characterized by spasms. Again, the more severe the situation, the more frequent the repetition. This is the golden rule in homeopathy. Then, as always, as the illness is abated, the remedy is used less frequently and eliminated once it’s resolved. 
* Calc phos is the choice when there is a cough that feels suffocative. The sufferer is comforted by lying down, and the mucus is stringy and tough. This remedy is of particular value for small, nervous women and children, but as is often seen in homeopathy, there is a broad value for each remedy. 
* Nat sulph 6X is the cell salt for those whose chest is sore from coughing. The mucus is thick and yellow, and there is a sensation of weakness or loss in the chest. This is most often useful after the cough and illness have ripened. 
1.10  Dandruff
* Banerji Protocol for dandruff—Antimonium crud 6, taken twice daily. Will gradually get better over a few months time
1.11  Dehydration
* Possible causes—heat stroke, vomiting, diarrhea
* Severe dehydration is very serious. An IV drip at a hospital may be necessary.
* Determine hydration level
? Thirst is not a good way to determine hydration level—if you are thirsty, you are already dehydrated
? Best way to determine hydration level— the color of your urine 
? Colorless urine indications over-hydration
? Light yellow color indicates proper hydration;
? Dark yellow color indicates dehydration.
? Next best ways to determine hydration level
? Frequency of urine
? Amount of your urine
* Treatment
? See 3.8 Hydration p. 9
? Hydrate slow and steady—maybe a tablespoon of water every 10 minutes.
? Bubbly water reopens the gut and rehydrates faster through the carbonation. If bottled mineral water of the bubbly kind is available, get some.
? In cases of profound fluid loss an electrolyte replacement solution is preferable to plain water. A homemade solution is better than Gatorade. See 9.6 Electrolyte drinks p. 87 
1.12  Depression, grief, sadness
* Ignatia amara 200C
* See http://joettecalabrese.com/blog/homeopathy-cures-grief-sadness-without-chemicals/?inf_contact_key=68a9067222765da3d58a41ae17c433de345bc6f748068aef1fcd0aa93dd9848d
1.13  Detoxing
* Detox and tonify (build up)
? Which comes first, the chicken or the egg? If you tonify your body, and make your organs strong, they will naturally detox. If you get toxins out, your organs will become stronger. 
? If a person is very weak, it is better to build up before detoxing
* Treat topically, systemically, and with nutrition
? Simply sweating (exercise)—expels toxins
? Take a shower with soap afterwards so toxins don’t get reabsorbed into the skin.
? Negative ions—healing
? Abundant in the deep woods, at waterfalls and ocean shores
? Ideally walk barefoot at the beach in the water9
? See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24 
? See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81 
? Organic sulfur and lots of water (sulfate things out)
? In general, raw foods are detoxing, cooked foods are building10
* Specific protocols
? See 6.42 Radiation p. 45
? See 6.59 Vaccines p 55
? From Hannah Bradford
? 1 hour before bedtime—cocktail of seaweed broth, miso, and cilantro extraction (to release toxins, especially aluminum) 
? Right before bed—1 T clay dissolved in water (to bind)
? Many advocates of cilantro for cleansing say that you should chase it with a clay slurry to carry out whatever the cilantro draws out and because cilantro draws out a lot, you need the clay to purge.
1.14  Diarrhea, digestive upset
* Preventative
? Have healthy, numerous, varied gut flora
? Use spices in daily cooking such as hing, turmeric, cumin, etc.
* Bacteria/viruses in our intestines can cause diarrhea. You body is trying to get rid of something. 
? See 7.33 Oregano oil* p. 70 or 7.46 Turmeric* p. 74 (both of these are very anti-microbial) 
? Follow up with charcoal/clay an hour later (to mop up the dead microbes)
? Also consider bitters, chamomile tea, peppermint tea, fennel (gas and bloating) and ginger 
* See 6.15 Dehydration p. 32
* When you start to eat again, start gently—easy to digest foods such as blended soups. Mainstream say BRAT diet (Bananas, Rice, Apple sauce, Toast). 

1.14.1. Dysentary
* Diarrhea with blood in the stools
* Consider Arsenicum
1.15  Dizziness, fainting
* Joette Calabrese on fainting 
? A unique way for the body to display stress.
? Fainting occurs when the heart suddenly fails in its normal action.
* Possible causes of fainting or dizziness
? After a hemorrhage, such as after surgery (or even donating blood)
? Hearing bad (or really good) news
? Hunger or dehydration
? Crowded rooms or sometimes the sight of blood
? Exhaustion
? Low blood sugar or low blood pressure
* Treatment
? For dizziness or feeling like you might faint
? Sit or lie down
? If you’re sitting down, try putting your head between your legs—this increases the blood flow to your brain. 
? For fainting
? Tight clothing may be a contributing factor, so it is best to gently lay the person flat, keeping the head low, loosening tight collars and waist bands 
? Asking others to step aside so that as much fresh air as possible is allowed to circulate 
? Try to identify the cause and take action when appropriate
? Dehydration—drink water
? Low blood sugar—eat
1.16  Dry, cracked skin
* Rub shea butter, aloe, etc. on skin (Use something you are willing to put in your mouth. Your body absorbs whatever you put on your skin)
* Get more healthy fats in your diet
* If skin is cracked on lips, the colon or the small intestine may need loving care.
1.17  Earache
* Basics
? Treat both ears—even if only one hurts
? Keep ears warm—especially if it’s cold outside. Consider wearing a hat to bed. The warmth is healing and comforting. 
? Use lymphatic massage. See 5.14 Lymphatic massage p. 21
* Charcoal and flaxseed poultice
? Mom’s favorite (it worked for her when other methods didn’t)
? Soak a piece of a cotton ball or a section of a gauze pad in the charcoal mixture and gently place in ear 
? For a more medicinal cotton ball, soak in colloidal silver instead of water.
? Put tape over ear so cotton stays moist
* See 9.3 Colloidal silver* p. 85
? According to the experienced colloidal silver users we’ve interviewed, less is more when it comes to treating ear infections with colloidal silver.
? Lie down on your side with the affected ear pointing upward.
? Put three drops in the affected ear, once or twice per day at most. Any more is not only a waste, but it can be counterproductive to effective treatment.
? Remain in this position for 6–7 minutes, allowing the colloidal silver plenty of time to seep down into the ear and begin killing the microbes.
? Then simply turn your head so that the affected ear is pointed downward, and allow the colloidal silver to drain out, using a clean piece of tissue paper to wipe it from the ear.
? In many cases, an ear infection clears overnight after the first application. But sometimes it takes 2–3 applications before results are noticed.
* Oil of oregano can only be used on the outside of the ear.
? Prepare a rub of oil of oregano in coconut or olive oil, then apply to outside of ear.
* Home-made options. Lie still for 10–15 minutes while applying option and massaging your year.
? Onion juice—warm up a small glass dish in toaster oven or in a double boiler or simply a pan of hot water. Place some onion in a garlic press and capture the juice in the warmed bowl. Dilute with olive oil (onion juice should be body temperature) Using a dropper place a few drops of the warm onion juice in the child’s ear. May have to do this one more time the next day—but often once does the trick. 
? Garlic oil (which is simply garlic infused into olive oil)—can be warmed and used in the ear as ear drops. The garlic oil may also be rubbed around the ear itself and used along the side of the neck in the lymphatic drainage massage. 
1.18  Electromagnetic fields (EMFs)
* Often vague symptoms—headache, sleeplessness, fatigue, tinnitus
* Remedies
? Distance is your friend—all EMF fields decrease with distance from the source
? A safe sleeping area is most important (since this is when you body rejuvenates)
? No transmitting devices should be in sleeping area. This includes cordless phones, baby monitors, Wi-Fi, cell phones, smart meters, etc.
? No cords, appliances or rechargers by your bed. Their electric field emanates a few feet
? Look around for things that might be causing EMFs (and avoid or mitigate them)
? Don’t sit next to a router 
? Don’t put a lap top computer directly on your lap
? Cell phones
* Use the speaker phone
* If you are holding it next to your ear, leave it at least ½ from your ear.
* Don’t carry it in you pocket, use your backpack or purse
? Consider pendents
? Zero Point Global
1.19  Eye infections
1.19.1. Styes
* About
? Common infection results from blocked glands within the eyelid.
* Treatment
? Warm compresses (charcoal)
? Light massage
1.19.2. Conjunctivitis, pinkeye
* About
? Inflammation of the conjunctiva, due to bacterial, or viral infection, allergens or irritants.
? If viral in nature, no antibiotic will touch it and it will secrete clear and watery tears, while discharges that are thick, yellow or greenish are usually bacterial. Even without treatment most of these infections resolve within 10 days or so.
* Treatment
? Treat both eyes, even if the infection is just in one eye
? Use an eye dropper and apply 2–3 drops of colloidal silver or activated charcoal slurry to each eye.
? Charcoal poultices over the eyes
? By the next day, the eyes should be clear
? See Joette Calabrese's blog— http://joettecalabrese.com/blog/pinkeye-conjunctivitis-homeopathy/?inf_contact_key=a090bcd1b8a7b6c25a388ac8675151e3aa253526c71bf3f0e3e4f340e5411a52
1.20  Fever
* About
? Fevers boost you bodies immune system. 
? Fevers create an inhospitable environment for invading organisms. They turn up the heat high enough that the invading microbes cannot live. 
? When you fill chilled, that is your bodies way is raising it’s temperature. When you are sweating, that is your bodies way of cooling you off.
* When to treat
? If someone has a high fever, but they feel okay, let it go. 
? If someone had a lower fever but they have horrible aches and pains, feel dizzy or out of it, then do something for it.
? Generally fevers up to 104.5°F are fine. Do not suppress them unless they rise too high or too quickly (rising to high or too quickly could cause a seizure). Some say fevers up to 106°F are fine. 
* How to support (and draw out) fever
? The fever will dehydrate you. You must keep drinking. If you're taking sulfur, which needs water, then you'd need to make a concerted effort to get plenty of water.
? Water with lemon juice will help to neutralize a fever.
? Fast or eat foods such as broths and water until the fever breaks. 
? Rest so the body has energy to do it’s job.
? Drink HOT or WARM teas (all but cayenne is easily grown in a garden)
? See 7.18 Elderflower tea* p. 67
? See 7.6 Boneset tea p. 64
? Cayenne—when someone feels cold and they are shivering.
? Lemon balm—for treating the common cold. The herb has a mild antiviral influence and helps sweat out a fever.
? Pleurisy Root (Butterfly Weed)—promotes sweating and the expulsion of toxic metabolic waste through the sweat. The herb reduces inflammation of dry mucous membranes and serous membranes, generally used to treat acute and severe symptoms of fever, pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis, asthma, cough or diarrhea.
? Yarrow—used for treating colds and sweating out fever. See 7.49 Yarrow*+ p. 75 
? Oil of oregano
? Charcoal (topical and internal)
? The cooling effect of a topical charcoal poultice is much greater than that of a wet pack. In case of high fever, the temperature can be brought down with the topical application of charcoal. Of course, the poultice will have to be changed frequently till the desired lowering of temperature is effected.
? Soak a couple washcloths in apple cider vinegar and place on forehead and stomach, or add a cup to a warm bath. Some people also soak a cloth and wrap it around the soles of the patient’s feet11
? Soak paper towels in egg whites and place them on the bottom of the feet, then cover with socks. Replace the socks/paper towels when they dry out. Most people report that they see results from this method very quickly – anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour12
? Homeopathy
* After the fever is gone, continue to support the body—e.g. bone broth.
1.21  Fungal, yeast infection
* Usually a topical skin condition, but can go systemic
* Fungal
? Athlete's foot
? Jock itch
? Ringworm
* Yeast
? Mouth (oral thrush)
? Urinary tract. See 6.58 Urinary track infections (UTIs) p. 55
? Vaginal yeast infection
* Tea tree oil and others are anti-fungal as well.
* Homeopathy
? Fungal infections—Antimonium crud 6 mixed w/ Arsenicum 200
1.22  Headache
* Migraine
? Put 1 t. organic sulfur on front of two front teeth (there is a meridian that goes straight up)
? Karta Purkh Singh Khalsa, herbalist and president of the American Herbalists Guild, recommends ginger for stopping a migraine:

In my observation, ginger is absolute best thing for treating a migraine at the time that it develops, one of the few things that will work at the time. Stir two tablespoons of ginger powder into water and drink it at the onset of visual disturbances — the “aura” — before the pain starts. Usually that will knock it cold. The migraine may try to restart in about four hours, in which case you have to do this again.

* Other type headaches—use oil of oregano
? Massage a small amount of oil into painful area and trigger points in the scalp.
? Mix in coconut oil or olive oil and massage on the bottom of your feet. 
? Inhale the oil frequently
? Take a few drops under the tongue
? Take a few drops dissolved in water
? Repeat until pain is resolved
* Try to identify the cause—dehydration, heat exhaustion, EMFs, etc.
* Smell lavender, lay down in a dark room
1.23  Hyperthermia
1.23.1. Heat exhaustion
* Body temperature too hot
* Heat exhaustion symptoms—elevated body temperature (101°F), headache, chills, and dizziness.
* Possibly the only thing charcoal and oil of oregano are not useful for.
* Prevention/treatment
? Drink lots of water
? Avoid overexertion on a hot day
? Seek out shade, remove any possible clothing (including shoes and socks)
? Dress in light colors and cool fabrics (natural fabrics are often cooler than polyester)
? Eat cooling foods—watermelon, cucumbers, ice cream
? Lay down
? If possible, spray body with a mist bottle filled with cool water. Else wet a bandanna to placed on neck or forehead, or gently pour water over you. Don’t shock yourself—e.g. jump in an ice cold lake. Fan yourself to speed the evaporation of water
? Take it easy for a few days. (At Girl Scout camp it was common for girls to get heat exhaustion. Often it took several days of rest and drinking for the body temperature to return to normal.)
* Pay attention to heat exhaustion symptoms, else heat exhaustion can turn into heat stroke. 
* For both heat exhaustion and heatstroke, all symptoms need not be present.
1.23.2. Heat stroke
* Heatstroke symptoms—high body temperature (104°F); hot dry red skin; person drowsy, irritated, confused or agitated.
* Follow previous advise, plus...
* For heatstroke, medical attention should be sought ASAP
1.24  Hypothermia
1.24.1. Cold, shivering
* Body temperature too cold
* Prevention/treatment
? Dress in layers—the air between each layer further insulates you
? Silk long underwear would be a good addition—it’s so light, you don’t even realize you’re wearing it
? Wear wool when possible (socks, hat)
? Consume warming foods and teas
? Use your oven—cook something delicious (just turning it on and heating the room can be dangerous)
? At night
? No electric blankets—the EMF trade off isn’t worth it
? Wear a wool hat—much of your body heat escapes through your head
? Wear wool socks
? Do no go to bed in any clothes which you wore during the day. They likely have perspiration and the moister will make you feel even colder at night.
? Fill a large hot water bottle, such as a water brick, with hot (almost boiling water), take it to bed with you. If the container is large enough, it will hold the heat all night
? Sleep with other family members inside a tent, which is pitched inside your house—the people will produce body heat which is then kept near to them with the tent
1.24.2. Frostbite
* Follow previous advise, plus...
* Slowly warm the effected areas. If you warm too quickly, this could be bad. The body has drawn it’s heat inward to protect the vital organs, so you do not want to shock the heat outwards
? Warm water 
? Immerse in water around 105°F–110°F 
? Body heat 
? For example, hold frostbitten fingers in the armpit.
? Mylar blankets
? Reflect and retaining heat in extreme weather conditions
? A mylar “sleeping bag” is better than a mylar blanket
? Oil of oregano 
? Dramatically improves circulation to the skin and outer tissues; the increased blood flow minimizes tissue damage. It speeds healing, aiding in the regeneration of skin. Furthermore, it prevents infection from developing in open wounds
? Apply directly to the involved area. Repeat as often as necessary.
? Homeopathy—Banerji Protocol
? Hamanelis 200C mixed with Arnica 3.
? For mild cases, take twice daily. For more severe cases, take every 1–3 hours. 
* Continue until circulation, color and sensation return.
1.25  Ingrown toenail
* Treat like infection/blister
1.26  Injuries
* Do not use ice. Ice congeals according to Chinese medicine.
* An injury disrupts the normal flow of blood and fluids the way a dam obstructs the flow of water through a stream. This results in a swollen area of stagnant fluids above the obstruction, which interferes with the normal movement of energy through the tissues causing them to heat up and turn red— inflammation and pain. Icing cools tissues and causes tiny blood vessels to contract, reducing the flow of blood and fluids into the injured area, reducing swelling. This is like shrinking a stream to reduce the size of a pond behind a dam.
* The problem with this approach is that it does not get rid of the dam itself, the obstruction caused by the injury. The obstruction remains and gradually thickens, interfering with full healing and normal function. Eventually, this can cause the affected tissues to start slowly breaking down and, in some people, lead to arthritis.
1.27  Insomnia
* Try one or more of the following before bed
? Epsom salt baths 
? Magnesium oil rubbed anywhere
? Organic sulfur
? Chamomile, Kava Kava or Valerian root tea 
? Lavender oil (inhale or put some on a cloth/bandanna and sleep next to it) 
? Warm milk (if you want, add cinnamon or nutmeg)
? Golden Milk 
? Tea from passion flowers
* See 6.22 Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) p. 34
1.28  Leaky gut
* Bone broth
* Marshmallow root, slippery elm, plantain leaves
? Rosalee likes a tea with marshmallow root and plantain (slippery elm is endangered)
? Marshmallow root is best cold infused. Fill container ¼ with marshmallow the fill with warm water. Let sit out overnight
? Or simmer tea which is ½ marshmallow root and ½ plantain leaves. The marshmallow root is more coating, the plantain is more healing
1.29  Lymph congestion
* Getting lymph moving helps with any condition—illness, cancer
* From Ingrid
? The lymphatic system in many people is overwhelmed by infection, often stemming from dental problems or immunizations.
? Secondly, there is often a heavy burden on the lymphatic system due to various toxins: preservatives in food and medicines; mercury, aluminum, lead, and other poisonous metals; chemicals from antiperspirants, dry cleaning agents, and so on and so forth. Reducing some of these burdens on the body will often relieve pressure on the lymphatic system and enable it to do its work.
? Thirdly, many parasites move in and out of the lymphatic system. This is a condition that is seldom diagnosed (and sometimes misdiagnosed as something else.) Everyone who has studied tropical diseases knows about filariasis but they seldom realize that people in the developed world can also be harboring similar parasitic infections.
* Treatments
? Rebounding
? Cleaver's tea
? Indigo drops
? Alkalizing foods and herbs
? Immune supplements
? Massage
1.30  Menstrual cramps
* Specific homeopathic tablets 
* Cell salts 
? Put 4 pills of Mag phos 6x in a cup of hot water
? Allow it to dissolve 
? Stir once
? Sip it every 30 seconds or so as long as the liquid remains hot.
* Red raspberry tea can be used preventively or with cramps
* Anything to increase circulation (apply heat, oil of oregano, etc. to abdomen)
1.31  Mold
* Symptoms—warning, they are vague, and could be because of other problems
? Pain, fatigue, headache, unexplained weight gain, respiratory illness, memory loss, and neurological illness
* Get out of the situation—if possible
* Remediation
? Clean topically 
? Bad options—anything that contains water, water causes the mold to return—Clorox, H2O2
? Good options
* Cleaning solution containing vinegar, borax, citrus oil and thieves (or clove) oil; spray and let sit overnight before scrubbing
* Apple cider vinegar
? Wear a nose mask when cleaning—also protect eyes and ears
? Books—Ingrid would personally wear a mask and gloves, clean them as best I can, put them outdoors in the sun, and mist them with lemongrass oil. If they can be readily replaced, I would imagine that it is more cost effective to replace them than to remediate.
? Diffuse thieves oil—to go after airborne spores
? Running a diffuser while remediating is not going to help a whole lot. It's better than nothing, but the purpose of the diffuser is to inhibit mold growth so you actually want to use it in areas that are susceptible to mold growth, such as basements, crawl spaces, and even inside the car since cars get parked in the rain and who knows what else. 
? Use nebulizing diffuser that does not use water13
? Diffuse heavily at first, then go down to diffusing once per week, finally once per month.
? Also, put diffuser on the return duct for the HVAC system. The vents are probably growing mold
? Mold spores have very a hard protective covering called chitin, similar to oyster shells. Mold can be dormant indefinitely and then emerge when the conditions favor its survival. By periodic misting, I believe I am limiting their opportunities. 
1.32  Motion sickness
* Homeopathic tablets for motion sickness
* Press the acupuncture point on the inside of your wrist (three fingers up from the wrist bend, and inside the two parallel lines). The harder you press, the better.
* Open window on vehicle for better air flow. Front of vehicle is usually better than back of vehicle for those prone to motion sickness.
1.33  Muscle soreness—overexertion
* Epsom salt baths
* Homeopathy—Arnica
1.34  Nosebleeds
* Sit and lean forward slightly, pinch nostrils closed for 3–4 minutes, breath through mouth
* If bleeding is severe, a powdery substance that is a hemostatic (something that stop bleeding) can be used. See 6.64 Wounds, abrasions p. 61
1.35  Parasites
* About
? Everyone has parasites—you just need the good guys outnumbering the bad. Your internal terrain should always be as inhospitable as possible to the bad guys
? Increased risk of bad parasites when traveling from colder to warmer climates (Mexico, Zimbabwe)
? Symptoms—vague, and could be because of other problems as well
? Digestive problems, chronic diarrhea, gas/bloating, itching around anus or vulva, worms in stool
? Parasites, as bad as they sound, can be beneficial. There likely is a “worser” problem which they are helping
? Heavy metals
* Parasites feed on heavy metals and often concentrate heavy metals in their bodies. Basically the concentration of heavy metals in the parasite becomes much greater than the concentration of heavy metals in you.
* Expel the parasites (together with their heavy metals) rather than kill the parasites and have the heavy metals reabsorbed in you.
* You can test for heavy metals—hair mineral analysis
* Detox heavy metals. See 6.56 Toxins—biological warfare, metals p. 54
? Leaky gut
* Parasites such as candida albicans serve a purpose—to clean up undigested proteins
* Take away the food source of the parasites by healing and sealing the gut. 
* Taking antibiotics to kill the parasites is harmful. You didn’t fix the root problem, and the parasites will ultimately come back with vengeance.
* Prevention
? Wash hands—keep your fingernails short and clean, be sure to wash hands after petting animals
? Avoid insect bites
? Concentrate on good elimination. It is essential for getting the inevitable parasites out.
? Make internal terrain as inhospitable as possible
? You don’t want to take supplements and/or feed the parasites, but proper chewing and food combining help you to get more of the nutrients than the parasites.
? Avoid
* Sugar and carbohydrates
* Raw or undercooked beef, pork, fish and chicken 
* Water chestnuts, watercress, unwashed fruits and vegetables
* Contaminated water 
? Include
* Water
* Digestive enzymes—help restore your intestinal tract to a balance state, which makes it inhospitable to parasites. Take 30 minutes before a meal
? GB-3, from Endomet Labs?
* Eat bitter foods and yang building foods (seafood and meats)
* Include oil of oregano, diatomaceous earth, activated charcoal, organic sulfur, probiotics (esp. lactobacilli), fermented foods, salt
* Coconut
? Natural cure for those infested with tapeworms and parasites. It is a cheap and highly effective remedy with no side effects.
? Young green coconut—use a Blendtec and blend the coconut milk and white pulp. Add papaya seeds for an extra anti-parasitic smoothie
? 200 grams of dried coconut followed with Epsom salt14
* Fruit—pineapple, papaya seeds, pomegranate and blackberries, lemon seeds (crushed)
* Vegetables—onions, green onions, garlic, kelp, carrots, beets, raw cabbage and garlic
* Nuts and seeds—pumpkin seeds (paralyzes critters, then you need to flush them out), sunflower seeds, almonds, garlic, calmyrna figs, cranberry juice 
* Herbs and pungent spices—cloves (kills eggs), curled mint (Mentha crispa), thyme, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, chilis, horseradish, juniper berries, and cayenne
* Drink—Tulsi tea (with honey to attract the worms), apple cider vinegar (increases stomach acid), fennel seed tea (mild laxative and irritant to certain parasites) 
* Treatments
? http://www.kitchendoctor.com/ayurveda/ayurveda_parasites.php
? They work in countless different ways which is why alternating protocols can sometimes be better than fanatic devotion to a single protocol.
? Test, if possible, so you know what you are treating—Stool tests15, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), muscle testing
? Options
? What you eat first thing in the morning is important. The critters are hungry, make it something toxic.
? Mix things up, parasites adapt
? Ingrid's ParaPro formulas—(the best, but doesn't work for tape worm)
* For more detailed information on these formulas, please read the material on http://www.kitchendoctor.com/parasite_infection/blood_parasites.php.
* Take about 20–30 minutes before meals. Two things might happen. The body will secrete more bile and the bile will kill some parasites as well as aid digestion. Once you start eating, the parasites will be lured to their death.
* Parasite cleanses are best begun just before the full moon. If you take Arjuna's Arrows for 1–2 days right before the full moon, you should destroy the parasites at their most active time. Continuing use of this formula does not generally yield better results because the body is busy cleaning up the dead parasites for 5–7 days following the death of the parasites. A bacterial infection similar to a mild case of flu is typical because friendly bacteria eat the dead parasites and this takes several days. During this time, we find that taking Dragon's Dreams reduces the achiness and grogginess of the process.
* When the bacteria are finished, white blood cells eat the bacteria. Phoenix Rising supports this phase of the process. It can be continued for a week or three weeks, depending on symptoms.
* In almost every case, the cycle will need to be repeated because parasites lay thousands, hundreds of thousands of eggs so even if the adult parasites are killed, there will be eggs and new batches of parasites, often for months. For best results, the entire family, including pets, should be treated at the same time, and the cycle should be repeated until there are no further signs of parasite infection. In most cases, 2–4 months of treatment will suffice but a few people who are continually reexposed, will have to continue for as long as two years. This, however, is rare.
* This program can be alternated with black walnut and/or Artemisia annua. These are relatively mild herbs that can be taken daily during the times people are not taking the ParaPro trio. 
? Parasitic herbs in a formula (woodworm, etc.). Must follow the exact protocol
* Systemic formulas—Hanna Kroeger
? Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt— http://www.sophiahi.com
* Liver compressions to get sticky bile out
? See 5.5 Castor oil packs* p. 14
? Homeopathy— http://www.happyherbalist.com/parasitecleansecompleteprogram.aspx
? Essential oils
? Infrared sauna
? Strengthen your liver—so it can help purge the critters out (e.g. Andreas Moritz’s liver tea)
1.35.1. Lice
* A parasite! 
* See 9.3 Colloidal silver* p. 85
* Oregano oil
? Add a dropper of oil of oregano to a tablespoon of shampoo. Wash hair thoroughly and let stand for several minutes. Rinse to remove shampoo.
? As a body wash add a full dropper of oil of oregano to a handful of liquid soap; wash all body regions except genitals. (For genital infection use a dilute solution to avoid burning sensation.)
? Clothes and bedding, add two or three droppers full of oil or oregano to the wash cycle.
* Coconut oil
? Apply it on the hair and scalp and cover with a shower cap
* Iodine
? With liquid iodine, use only 2–3 dabs of iodine on the scalp, twice a week. Iodine will help kill eggs by destroying those with which it comes into contact. 
? Note—do not use any more than 2–3 dabs of iodine two times per week, as iodine is absorbed into the skin. We need iodine, but do not want to overdo it.
* See 6.39 Parasites p. 41
1.35.2. Pin worm
* When the classroom epidemic is pin worms, homeopathy provides a great little remedy that is reputed to be just as powerful not only for eliminating pin worms but also as a prophylactic. The alternative is not pleasant. Conventional medicine will suggest a vermicide. The suffix "cide" means to kill. This means that the active ingredient is a pesticide that kills the worms. 
* The remedy Cina instead creates an unfriendly environment so that the worms will expel themselves. Cina tincture can be used by adding 6 drops to water and then sipping the water throughout the day. This should be done for 15 days in a row and then repeated one month later, say the homeopaths of India, who use this remedy regularly. 
1.36  Poison ivy
* Wash all sheets, clothing, towels, etc. (the oils stay on a surface for weeks and can reinfect you.
* If isolated blisters, simple treat individual blisters.
* If everywhere, try baths, etc. and internal systemic treatment.
? Activated charcoal (to remove toxins)
? Homeopathy
? Pack Croton tiglium in your backpack for when a poison ivy outbreak is blistering a great deal with inflammation and itching. It is particularly useful for when the outbreak is located on the scalp, near the eyes or on the genitals. 
? If the eruption is of a burning nature that causes severe itching and aggravated by the warmth of a bed, the night and by scratching, consider Rhus tox. This powerful remedy is particularly interesting in that it is made from poison ivy.
? Luke Tian's tea
1.37  Poisoning—food, chemical, pharma
* Phone numbers
? Poison Control Center 1-800-222-1222
? Animal Poison Control Center 1-888-426-4435
* Food
? Take charcoal orally
? See 6.15 Dehydration p. 32
? Once you start to feel better, bone broth and ginger tea are recommended.
* Other
? Manually induce vomiting by massaging the back of the throat with a finger. 
? Do not induce vomiting for ingestion of gasoline, kerosene, lighter fluid, or an acid or caustic agent.
? For acid, neutralize with baking soda in water. For caustic agents, neutralize with vinegar in water.
? Administer charcoal as soon as possible while patient is conscious and able to swallow. For unconscious patients, poultices have been know to work.

? Estimated amount of poisoning
? 1 t.
* If no food eaten in last 2 hours...1–2 T. charcoal in water followed with 2 glasses of water
* If food given in last 2 hours...4–10 T. charcoal in water followed with 2 glasses of water
? 1 T.
* If no food eaten in last 2 hours...3–4 T.
* If food given in last 2 hours...6–15T
? Repeat all dosages in 10 minutes, and again if symptoms begin to worsen.
1.38  Radiation
1.38.1. Essentials
* Have abundant minerals in your body so that the radioactive elements have no place to go
? Potassium protects from cesium 137
? Iodine protects protects the thyroid from radioactive iodine
? Base treatment on the half life of the elements that you are exposed to.
? Cesium 137 has a half life of thousands of years
? PET/CT radiation has a half life of only 24–48 hours.
? See 6.17 Detoxing p. 32
* Eat miso soup with seaweed, etc. 
* Detoxing baths
? See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24
? Radiation ingredients
? Clay
? One cup each of baking soda and salt
* Sulfur 
? See 9.18 Sulfur* p. 91
? Background radiation—1 t. 2 times day
? PET/CT—1 T. 3 times per day, the day before, the day of and the day after (this type of radiation is short lived)
? Fukushima-type event—See PET/CT, but continue treatment for longer since the half life is longer.
* Calcium bentonite clay
? Maintenance dose 1–3 t. per day on an empty stomach
? Therapeutic dose—double the maintenance dose
? Can be constipating, drink water.
* Coconut charcoal 
? Coconut charcoal is better than hardwood charcoal for radiation
? Same dosing as calcium bentonite clay
? Can be constipating, drink water.
* Melatonin 
? A one-time dose of 300 mg of melatonin before exposure to radiation is effective
* Homeopathic remedies from Joette Calabrese for major atomic events
? Cadmium sulph 30 or Potassium iodide 30— taken once before and once after an atomic explosion. These are generally used before symptoms appear but can be used after as well for many weeks or even months, especially if symptoms present.
? Cobaltum 30C—known to remove side effects of radiation by taking it 4 times per day for 2–3 days. Then an assessment is done to determine if more is needed and how often. Generally, it’s used from that time forward 4 times in one day every two weeks for 2–3 months. In the hands of a skilled homeopath, this remedy can be used in 200 potency.
? Radium bromatum 30C—used when skin eruptions or arthritis appear. It is generally taken twice daily if symptoms are mild and up to 5 times per day if more severe. This remedy has been used for as long as many weeks, but better if possible under the watchful eye of a skilled homeopath.
? Arsenicum album 30X*—repeated doses every few minutes for approximately 1–2 days…then as needed depending on the symptoms.
? Phosphorus, 30X* and 200 and 1M—one after the other in the same fashion as Arsenicum album 30X. Combined, these have a history of being a very useful first aid.
? (Cell salts) Calc fluor 12C and Nat mur 6C— used 3 times daily for months after exposure to radiation and more frequently, if necessary. Regardless of which other remedies are chosen from above, these two remedies have a way of helping the body eliminate toxins 
1.38.2. Fukushima
* See above suggestions, the radiation won’t be going away anytime soon, so go on a protocol you can stick with. Seaweed/miso multiple times per week is helpful
* Be careful what you eat—eat low on the food chain, root vegetables better than leafy greens. 
* East coast food less contaminated than west coast food
1.38.3. Dirty bombs
* Radiation from health tests is generally dangerous for a day or two probably tops. Radiation from an atomic bomb lasts much longer
* If you are outside
? Cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to reduce the risk of breathing in radioactive dust or smoke. Better yet, use your first aid kit mask
? Quickly go into a building where the walls and windows have not been broken. This area will shield you from radiation that might be outside. 
? Once you are inside, take off your outer layer of clothing and seal it in a plastic bag if available. Put the cloth you used to cover your mouth in the bag, too. Removing outer clothes may get rid of up to 90% of radioactive dust. 
? Immediately take a bath with charcoal or clay. Be sure to wash your hair. 
* If you are inside
? If the walls and windows of the building are not broken, stay in the building and do not leave. 
? Shut all windows, outside doors, and fireplace dampers. Turn off fans and heating and air-conditioning systems that bring in air from the outside. 
? If you are in an apartment building, seal air flow registers with duct tape and plastic
? If windows are leaky, seal with duct tape and plastic
? Put as much mass between you and the source as possible. Mass is your friend since it absorbs radiation.
? A great starting point for your shelter is a basement.
? If you don’t have a basement, the center of your house is a good place to be.
? If the walls and windows of the building are broken, go to an interior room and do not leave. If the building has been heavily damaged, quickly go into a building where the walls and windows have not been broken. If you must go outside, follow above outside instructions.
1.39  Rashes, hives
* Joette Calabrese says “All skin difficulties such as eczema, psoriasis, warts, acne and the like are outward pathologies that represent the inner health of the person. If we listen to what our skin is telling us, we can often uproot a deeper pathology and return our bodies to a healthier state.”
* Rashes are a sign your body is trying to get rid of toxins. There are various causes
? Final stage of a virus—chicken pox
? Exposure to certain environmental factors—sunlight, wind, heat
? Irritating substances—laundry detergent
? Allergies—food or medicine
* As always, treat multiple ways
? See 9.3 Colloidal silver* p. 85
? Oil of oregano—it seems to help with everything
? Allergies (reduce histamine)
? Local raw honey—a few spoonfuls daily
? Raw apple cider vinegar—1 oz. in water up to 3 times daily
? Quercetin—as a supplement or as food (garlic, onion, apples and cayenne pepper)
? Chamomile—drink the tea then put the bags over you eyes for 10 minutes to reduce itchiness)
? Homeopathy
? Hives—Apis 6 or Urtica urens 30
? Topically with lard, unsalted butter, plain yogurt, coconut oil or olive oil. Also Dave Wetzel of Green Pastures has a number of testimonials of folks healing skin conditions with his cod liver oil applied topically.16 Unpronounceable ingredients don’t belong in or on your body.
? Topically with an Epsom salt, clay or charcoal baths
? Depending on location, topically with honey, charcoal or clay 
? Internally with activated charcoal (to help absorb and adsorb the toxins which are coming out through the skin)
? Open up the pores which helps the body eliminate rashes. The same mechanism works for fevers.
? Nutritionally
? Eat anti-inflamatory, cleansing and probiotic foods—miso, seaweed, olive oil, salmon, and tumeric. 
? Get abundant Vitamin C—acerola powder, rosehip tea
? Drink lots of fluids (especially water) 
? The following sections provide detailed information
? See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24
? See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81
? See 9.2 Clay* p. 84
? See 9.11 Manuka honey* p. 89 
1.40  Raynaud’s syndrome
* See 6.28 Hypothermia p. 37, these homeopathic remedies work for exposure of the extremities to extreme cold and they work for Raynaud’s (Joette Calabrese) 
1.41  Scars
* About
? Scar effect the electrical flow in your body. You want to do everything to avoid them or remove them.
? Scars that affect you the most are usually midline on the face.
* Treatments (the sooner you treat, the beter)
? Topically
? Manuka honey (initially, when there is chance of infection)—muscle tested 2nd strongest for clearing scars, can be used on open wounds
? Miranda Castro's healing creams for scars—muscle tested stronger than any of the other products for clearing scars, not for open wounds
? Micellized vitamin A and natural vitamin E help to improve tissue integrity, normalize mucous membranes, heal micro-lesions, and clear up scar tissue
? Hot castor oil packs minimize surface scar tissue and loosen up adhesions. See 5.5 Castor oil packs* p. 14
? Procaine (need a practitioner)
? Rio Rosa Mosqueta Oil (cold pressed)
? Feathered Turtle (Ingrid Naiman)—better than Rio Rosa Mosqueta Oil
? A remedy is used in the Amazon to remove scars after they occur: Oil of Canela ("Ishpingu" in the Pastaza Quechuan dialect).
? Internally
? See 9.18 Sulfur* p. 91. Although it takes time. 
? Lots of bone broth 
? Turmeric (Ingrid Naiman)
? Other—look up neural therapy
? Movement is good, it helps to break up the scar tissue. Do not use movement to the point of pain.
? When applying the oil, use scar massage. This further helps to break up the scar.
? Homeopathy
? Keloids and scars—Thiosinominum 6 (this is in Miranda Castro's healing cream)
1.42  Staph, MRSA, sepsis
* Signs: swollen, irritated skin (redness), blisters filled with pus (a boil), or a high fever. If it's a clear boil, it's O.K., just not a yellow pus filled boil.
* It often begin as a minor cut. Sometimes you have no idea where it came from.
* It's contagious, wear gloves when helping someone
* Best avoided in the first place. Have a strong immune system. Treat injury topically and internally. Consider Manuka honey topically and oil or oregano internally.
* MRSA is a drug resistant staph. Have seen it cured with Manuka Honey. 
* Sepsis—when staph (bacteria) is in the blood
? Signs: chills, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate and high fevers
? The majority of cases of sepsis are due to bacterial infection.
? Sepsis is treated with hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and therapy to support any organ dysfunction.
1.43  Shock
* Causes
? A severe injury. [A neighbor got a really bad bite from a dog. I controlled bleeding and called the ambulance. After the ambulance arrived, the person went into convulsions (shock). I didn’t treat for shock, maybe it would have helped.]
? Large drop in body fluids, such as following a severe burn or severe vomiting and/or diarrhea
? Blood poisoning from major infections
? Exposure to extreme heat or cold for too long
* Sign and symptoms
? Pale (or blueish) skin
? Moist and clammy skin—if perspiration has occurred
? Weakness
? Rapid pulse (over 100) and often too faint to be felt at the wrist.
? Rate of breathing is usually increased, it may be shallow, possibly deep, and irregular.
? Possibly vomiting or retch from nausea.
* Treatment
? For a bad injury, treat for shock—anticipate that it might happen
? Calm the injured
? Bach Flower Essences Rescue Remedy
? Improve circulation and ensure an adequate supply of oxygen
? If they’re pale, raise their tail. Have person lay down on their back, with their legs elevated 6–12 inches (except in head injury). Loosen tight fitting clothing such as belts and collars.
? Take activated charcoal internally. It can't hurt, plus it might reduce the vomiting that results in dehydration (which can be life threatening)
? Maintain normal body temperature
? Keep them comfortable, possibly cover them with a blanket so they don’t get chilled.
? Get medical help
1.44  Sinus infections
* Sanguinaria 200 mixed with Belladonna 6, every 3 hours if severe or twice daily if mild. It’s likely that within a few days, she would be able to stop using this protocol (designed by the Banerjis)
1.45  Sore throat
* See 9.3 Colloidal silver* p. 85
* Gargle with salt, or better yet apple cider vinegar
* Oil of oregano
* Often the first sign of a cold or flu. See 6.60.2 Colds, flu p. 57
* Homeopathy
? Take Hepar sulph 30 every 3 hours (this will take care of most sore throats)
? If the sore throat is really severe take Belladonna 30
1.46  Splinters
* Essentials
? If the splinter is small, your body will dissolve it—but you can help it along with soaking and poultices. 
? Your body can not dissolve a piece of glass. You must use clay or charcoal (soaks and poultices) on it until you are sure every last bit is removed.
? Watch for infection (redness) at splinter site. Charcoal, clay, honey, or oil of oregano can be used to treat infection.
* Tweezers and needles (most of us want to avoid them) 
? Soak splinter in warm water to make the removal easier
? Sterilize tweezers or needle before and after use.
? Use tweezers or a needle to draw splinter out gently and completely
* Charcoal or clay
? Soak in water containing something to draw splinter (charcoal or clay) 
? Make a patch or poultice with something drawing (charcoal or clay). 
* Manuka honey 
? Might also work. Applying it is easy since there is nothing to prepare.
1.47  Sprains, strains, breaks, bruises
* Whatever you do within the first 24–48 hours of the injury, will dictate the rest of your recovery.
* Internally (and immediately)—see 8.3.1 Aconitum nap (Aconite) 30* 200* p. 76; 8.3.3 Arnica montana 30C* 200C* p. 77
* If injury is on the arms, remove any rings below the injury. If the area has already swelled, something slippery like coconut oil is very helpful.
* Rest the injured area, but if you have range of movement (without pain), movement promotes fluid drainage and prevents any build-up of scar tissue 
* If you suspect a break, immobilize the joints above and below the injury. Sometimes breaks are not obvious. You feel fine and have range of motion with a minor exception. If in doubt, immobilize and get an x-ray.
* Contrast therapy—alternate between hot and cold every 2 minutes, for 3–4 cycles… repeating this every few hours up to 3–4 times per day. (greatly reduces pain) While in the hot water attempt to spell the alphabet with your foot, and while in the cold water rest your foot completely. If your ankle is still swollen, then end this cycle with 2 minutes in cold water… otherwise end the cycle with two minutes in the hot water. The point of this is to increase the size of your blood vessels with exercising in the hot water, and contract them while at rest in the cold water. This creates a pumping effect, which can help drain the fluid and reduce pain much faster. 
* A clay or charcoal poultice or arnica cream or oregano oil—all support healing
* Elevate the injury above heart height whenever practical
* Your diet also matters during the initial phase. It’s recommended to not eat or drink anything cold, since it will slow down your entire body’s blood circulation and thus the healing process. 
* Also, having someone massage the injured area (or even self-massaging) can be helpful to move the blood around, as long as it is not causing pain. 
* After the first few days, when most of the swelling has gone away, you may want to soak your ankle in warm water that has Epsom Salt in it for 15–20 minutes at a time. This will also help circulate the blood while relaxing the muscles due to its magnesium and sulfate composition. It also is able to help reduce inflammation and pain, although not as effectively as the contrast therapy in the beginning. Add about two cups of Epsom salt to a bath or about a cup to a smaller container used to soak your foot separately. See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24
* See 9.18 Sulfur* p. 91—take double does. It helps the body mend
* The main thing to remember is not to create significant discomfort as you recover; this is a sign that you are aggravating the injured tissues, which can prolong your recovery time.
1.48  Sunburn 
 1.48.1.1  
* Prevention
? Wide brimmed hat, long pants, long sleeves
? Shea butter contains a natural mild sun block—SPF 6
? TerraSport™ (sunscreen with out nano particles), only when absolutely necessary
* Aloe Vera (juice directly from plant is best) Aloe mixed with Willard Water yields even more amazing results. If aloe is unavailable try coconut oil or Calendula tincture.
* Colloidal silver spray
* Homeopathy (Joette Calabrese)
? Cantharis 30C
? The first remedy she tries is Cantharis 30C. It’s useful for all sorts of burns including scalds and chemical burns. Use a potency that matches the severity of the burn. The more severe the burn, the higher the potency. 
? For mild sunburn a 6C, 12C or 30C is likely to do the trick. For a more serious case with severe pain, chills, and blistering, a dose of 200C may be needed. But first seek advice from a seasoned homeopath. 
? When treating an acute condition such as sunburn, use this general rule: the more severe the pathology, the more frequently the remedy needs to be repeated. 
? So if the sunburn is moderate—very red but without blistering—and you’re using a 30C potency, you might offer it every 30–60 minutes. 
? Use pain as your guide to determine how often to dose. 
? If after giving Cantharis there is no improvement, consider two other remedies. 
? Urtica urens is the remedy of choice if the pain has a prickly, stingy or itchy sensation. In fact, if the sensation is of this nature from the beginning, then start with this remedy and don’t bother with Cantharis. 
? For a deep, severe burn, use Causticum. The more severe the burn, the more likely that Causticum is the correct remedy. Causticum is also handy for old burns that have taken a long time to heal. 
? You should see a reduction in intensity of symptoms with 30–40 minutes of taking the correct remedy.
? Calabrese also likes to alternate cell salts with higher potency remedies.
? For instance, if you have determined that Cantharis 30C is the correct remedy, then alternate Kali mur 6X with Cantharsis 30C every 30 minutes or so to bring down the discomfort and pain. 
? Always stop when there’s improvement
1.49  Teeth
1.49.1. Planned tooth extraction
* Ask about
? Lugol’s iodine solution (six drops of actual Lugol’s iodine in 1/2 cup of water). very gently swish:
1. immediately before procedure
2. immediately after procedure
3. upon returning home
* Suggested before–and after–care
? 14 days prior (and continue supplements until as least one month after)
? Organic sulfur (healing support)
? Acerola powder (Vitamin C for healing support)
? Skate liver oil/butter oil
? Amino acids, e.g. bone broth (to help wounds heal faster)
? 3 days prior
? Arnica 30C (to increase blood flow to areas where trauma has occurred, hereby reducing pain and swelling.)
? Extraction day
? Arnica 30C in the morning and also just before entering the chair (Arnica is used to prevent infection, minimize shock to the system, reduce swelling, suppress hemorrhage, and often calm the patient.) 
? Make sure the periodontal ligament is removed and a good blood clot is formed
? Take it VERY easy for the first 24 hours. If you disrupt the blood clot, there will be problems later
* Hopefully only ride a few miles home 
* Recline and relax all day
? Arnica montana 30C as soon as possible after the surgery (3–5 pellets every 20 minutes until symptoms subside) use Arnica before Hypericum (Hypericum is for extreme pain, particularly when a nerve is injured. The more extreme the nerve pain, the more specific Hypericum becomes. Hypericum also helps deter infection and calm the nerves.) 
? Alternate between the Arnica and Hypericum. Recent double-blind research has confirmed its effectiveness. Studies showed that when Hypericum was given in alternation with Arnica to people after tooth extraction, they experienced significantly less dental pain as compared to those given a placebo.
? No antibiotics, no pain relievers and no Valium
? Other remedies to consider
* Mag Phos 6x (for relaxing gums, pain killer + reducing swelling if any)-2 tabs dissolved in warm water one glass sip by sip whenever it pains in extracted tooth.
* Ruta 30C (Before and after a tooth extraction to reduce pain and speed healing; bone and periosteal pain after dental surgery; bone pain in and after any oral surgery; and scraping of the periosteum; bone and periosteal pain after dental surgery.)
* Staphysagria 30C (Indicated for incisions of soft tissues such as periodontal flap procedures, impacted third molars where access flaps must be performed or periodontal graft procedures) Potency 30C—five pellets every 30 minutes until symptoms abate
* Hepar sulph may be started after extraction, next day morning (Prevention of any infection/pus formation) 
? Topically
* Arnica cream and/or charcoal poultices
* Minimal icing (only for a few hours after surgery)
? Extraction day +1
? Continue Arnica and Hypericum
? Particle-free food; drink lots of bone broth
? Begin rinsing (use alternate rinse)
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 drops tea tree essential oil
* 2 drops clove essential oil
* Just HOLD in mouth for at least 30 seconds every hour or so. This does three things. It helps the incisions/stitches heal, tea tree is an antibacterial so it helps prevent infection and both tea tree and clove have pain-relieving properties so it can reduce pain quite a lot.
? Extraction day +2
? Continue homeopathy if needed
? Drink blended solid food
1.49.2. Toothache
* Apply oil of oregano, clove oil, charcoal, or Manuka honey on cotton ball in mouth—or put charcoal powder directly on the effected tooth
* Topically apply a charcoal poultice or patch to the cheek—even a poultice or patch left on for 30–60 minutes a few times a day is fine. In the evening leave the final application on over night.
* Take charcoal internally
* Do salt water rinses (swishing)
* Do oil pulling. If during initial stages of infection, this is painful, rinse with salt water first and apply clove oil mixed with olive or coconut oil to the affected tooth, then try oil pulling with a drop of clove oil when tooth is less sensitive.
1.49.3. Tooth knocked out
* Find the tooth and immediately rinse, do not scrub, it off with plain or salt water.
* Place tooth back into the socket (The best hope for success is if the tooth is re-inserted within five minutes.)
* If you can get to your dentist within an hour, but are unable to re-insert the tooth into the socket, you should store the tooth in the tooth owner’s saliva or in cold milk. 
1.49.4. Preventative oral healthier
* Flossing—coat dental floss with anti-bacterial essential oil
* Brush with charcoal every few days to detox your mouth, for whiter teeth, etc.
1.49.5. Tooth decay
* Dr Steinman found is what causes the dentinal fluid to flow one way or the other was the balance of mineral phosphorus in the blood
* If blood phos is > 3.5, dentinal fluid flows healthy. If it’s < 3.5, fluid flow reverses and promotes decay. 
1.50  Tests—blood, urine
* Pyrroles
? 11% of the population has this condition
? Means you will always need extra B6 and zinc
? You don't need a doctor's script. See http://www.riordanclinic.org/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=bcl&Product_Code=LPyr&Category_Code=
1.51  Tetanus (lockjaw)
* A rare disease caused by bacteria known as Clostridium tetani. A toxin produced by the bacteria affects the function of the nerves and leads to severe muscle spasms in the abdomen, neck, stomach, and extremities. Tetanus can either be localized to one part of the body or generalized, with muscle spasms throughout the body. 
* The disease has been called lockjaw since the muscle spasms in the face and neck can lead to the inability to open the mouth, and this is one of the most common symptoms of tetanus. Tetanus is a serious illness that is fatal in up to 30% of cases.
* The bacteria that cause tetanus can be found in soil, manure, or dust. They infect humans by entering the body through cuts or puncture wounds, particularly when the wound area is dirty. Animal bites, burns, and non-sterile injection of drugs can also lead to infection with Clostridium tetani. 
* The first symptoms of tetanus can appear any time from three days to weeks after infection, but the average time until symptom onset is eight days.
* A clean wound and strong immune system go a very long way toward preventing tetanus.
* Warning, doctors over-prescribe the shot, take good care of your wound and most of the time say “no thank you” to the shot.
1.52  Toxins—biological warfare, metals
* The use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with intent to kill or harm
? Bacterial
? Anthrax, Black Death
? Viral
? Smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, agents of viral encephalitis, swine flu
* Minimize toxic exposures—use your first aid kit mask
* Chemicals
? Seek high ground. Chemical agents are more dense than air
? Follow 6.42 Radiation p. 45—except 
? Mass absorbs radiation, not biological and chemical toxins 
? You want to be high in a building, not low in a basement
? See 6.17 Detoxing p. 32
* Metals—Ingrid
? The original Omura study produced outstanding results without use of any binders. Some people are poor excreters and may have better results with a binder. I have yet to find someone who really needed these. I think it is more important to keep the kidneys and bowels working.
? Cilantro Extract from Sacred Medicine Sanctuary. Before using, we strongly recommend that you read all the material on toxic metal chelation on Kitchen Doctor. Not everyone reacts in the same manner to this product so extreme caution should be exercised when using this extract of a seemingly simple culinary seasoning. If you have braces or amalgams, you need to avoid allowing the cilantro to contact the metals. If this happens, rinse your mouth several times and spit out the cilantro, water, and saliva.
? Most people use cilantro in conjunction with chlorella, the theory being that cilantro mobilizes metals but chlorella bonds with them in such a way to allow the body to dispose of the toxins safely. However, no chlorella was used in the original tests of cilantro and we are not reordering this product until proof of safety is demonstrated.
? Because the metals will pass through eliminatory channels, support for the kidneys and lower intestines is highly recommended. However, since symptoms vary enormously and are not consistent from day-to-day much less person-to-person, the benefits of careful preparation, moderation, and attention to limits in the ability to eliminate efficiently is advised.
? The adjunctive products can be found on Toxic Teeth.
? There is also a Word document that you can download that contains other interesting information on teeth
* Treatments
? See 6.17 Detoxing p. 32
1.53  Unconsciousness
* Causes
? Major illness or injury a car accident—severe blood loss, a blow to the chest or head
? Complications from drug use or alcohol abuse.
* Treatment
? Check to see if the person is breathing, if not administer CPR
? Get medical help
? A liver poultice, homeopathy (the tablets will still dissolve under the tongue), and essential oils have been know to awaken unconscious people.
1.54  Urinary track infections (UTIs)
* A stinging pain while urinating
* The bacteria in the urinary bladder are similar to those in the stomach—hopefully lactobacteria, largely L. crispatus and L. jensenii. If not, the bad guys can take over, thus causing an infection.
* More susceptible when you’re pregnant. Doctor’s tell you it’s normal to get a UTI when pregnant—that does not make it right or good. Campbell-McBride suggests pregnant women rub yogurt or kefir around their vagina to prevent such an infection. It is common to do so in traditional cultures. 
* Yarrow—taken as a lukewarm or cold tea one can experience more diuretic properties, making it a powerful antiseptic for bladder infections
* Cranberry juice
* Oil of oregano
* Probiotics
* Drink water
1.55  Vaccines
* Use highest grade charcoal and clay possible. Charcoal addresses additives and chemicals in vaccines such as antifreeze. Clay addresses metals in vaccines such as aluminum. John Dinsley refers to a study removing toxins with clay and/or charcoal. The study says it is best just to stick with charcoal, and not try to alternate both clay and charcoal.
* Take charcoal an hour before receiving the vaccination. The vaccine starts binding with your blood immediately and you want the charcoal there to start working immediately.
* Put a charcoal compress over the vaccination site —some of the toxins stay near the injection site at first
? Use a 2'' x 2'' piece of gauze
? Put the moist charcoal/water mixture onto the gauze
? Place over the vaccination site
? Cover with plastic wrap to hold in the moisture (charcoal must be moist to work)
? Use vet wrap to keep the plastic wrap in place. Do not constrict the arm.
? Change every 2–3 hours as needed. Continue for 48 hours.
? The charcoal will temporarily stain your skin (a few days). 
* Alternate taking charcoal and clay orally—2 charcoal and 2 clay per day for one week 
? See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81; 1 T. in 4–6 oz. of water, then drink extra water
? See 9.2 Clay* p. 84 1 T. in 4–6 oz. of water, then drink even more water. 
* Sleep with a charcoal patch over the liver for a week (or better yet entire trunk). Use about 3 T. charcoal per poultice. 
* Clay bath 
? Every other day for a week. 
? See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24
* Sulfur 
? Helps protect anyone who must be vaccinated. It removes heavy metals.
? Take normal dose (every 12 hours) before, during, and after vaccination is administered. 
? See 9.18 Sulfur* p. 91
* CH-77 
? Homeopath Joette Calabrese found CH-77 the most powerful chelator for removal of heavy metals. 
* Eat healthy and rest before and after the vaccination. 
? Ferments 
? Vitamin A
? Vitamin C
* Get one vaccination at a time—no combo vaccines such as MMR
* The flu vaccine is one of the worst because it ranks at the top for preservatives.
* Do not do anything to reduce glutathione production. Tylenol reduces glutathione production and doctors tell mother’s to give this to their babies before and after vaccination!
* Tylenol, aspirin and their ilk also interfere with the enzyme cascade, which is necessary for everything to function.
1.56  Viral infection
1.56.1. Essentials
* About
? Viruses are tinier then bacteria: the largest of them are smaller than the smallest bacteria. 
? All they have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. 
? Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. 
? In most cases, they reprogram the cells to make new viruses until the cells burst and die.
? Viruses are quite specific about the cells they attack—liver, respiratory system, or blood
* From Bevin Clare, herbalist and nutritionist
? The best way to approach viral infections is to bolster the innate (and adaptive) immune response, to enhance tissue integrity, to foster healthy circulation, detoxification, and elimination.
? In many cases the virulence of a virus is caused more by the hunt and chase of the body than of the action of the virus itself. In fact, many viruses which can hide successfully live within us, typically without causing any cause for attention, unless something perturbs the balance. 
? These powerful inflammatory responses aren't something you want to stop altogether as they are effective and important. But they often need to be modulated.
? These powerful inflammatory responses aren't something you want to stop altogether as they are effective and important. But they often need to be modulated.
* Prevention
? Charcoal, coconut oil, and bone broth can be used preventively—especially during cold and flu season
? See 3 Prevention (and healing) principles p. 8
* Treatment
? For any serious viral infection, 5 grams of liposomol C daily for 10 days is recommended. For more details, please visit two earlier Natural Society articles on this subject.

? Oregano oil—see 7.33 Oregano oil* p. 70
? Biggest mistake is not taking it often enough. 
? If congested, use the oil under your tongue (or mixed in coconut oil or olive oil on the bottom of your feet) so that it goes to your sinuses
? Activated charcoal
? Helps remove toxins so your body can concentrate on healing. 
? There is a volume of waste from infections and this waste product is very toxic. 
? See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81
? A teaspoon of honey before bed to quiet coughs and help you sleep
? Warm tea with honey, warm bone broth, lots of liquids, limit food intake (your body needs to focus on healing, not digestion).

* Rosalee
? Taking a hot cayenne tea (or hot ginger tea) is one of the first things I do when I feel a cold or flu coming on. 
? Not only does this speed the healing process and shorten the duration of a cold or flu, it also feels really good on the throat (ironically). 
* Oil of oregano. See 7.33 Oregano oil* p. 70
* Homeopathy. There are three stages to a cold. Each stage has a specific symptom and a specific remedy. Remember not to use homeopathic remedies with strong scents such as oregano oil.
? The next time you get a cold that is ushered in with lots of sneezing and a copious amount of watery mucus, run, don’t walk, to the bottle of Nat mur 6x. This influential remedy is nearly infallible for squarely facing a cold as long as these symptoms fit. But do it soon. You’ll find it most valuable at the first sign of a cold. It will often abort a cold entirely if taken early enough.
? Once the achiness has begun, then Ferr phos will be indicated. As I stated before, Ferr phos 6x is the quintessential remedy to use when in doubt for ANY inflammation, and a cold is no exception. It can be diarrhea, the feeling of fatigue or the sensation of a forthcoming fever. 
? That is until the third stage evolves, at which time, Kali mur will bring up the rear. It will be accompanied by white phlegm, congestion and stuffiness. Regardless of which one you choose, take the remedy every 15 minutes to start and then, as this group of symptoms abates, open up the frequency to every 30–60 minutes. When this stage has passed (and you’ll note that it will be rather quickly resolved), look at the next set of symptoms
1.56.3. Ebola
* Use a combination of preventative strategies
? See 3 Prevention (and healing) principles p. 8
? Sharry Edwards, a BioAcoustic decoder, says a common thread in Ebola cases in copper toxicity (which weakens the cell walls). Copper toxicity is appearing all over the country and an explanation would be the copper they are spraying for “geo-engineering”
? Build your immunity
? The first is avoidance of substances that crash the immune system. These include fluoride, chlorine, and many other chemicals typically found in treated water as well as countless pharmaceuticals and harsh chemicals, including vapors that are inhaled, not just what is ingested.
? One very important and often overlooked measure of defense is the perfection of our lipid structures. The slipperiness of the membranes protecting our erythrocytes is nearly always overlooked by patients and health care practitioners. When we are worried about a hemorrhagic virus, this consideration is very important.
? We can improve our diets by at least 30%, perhaps 50%, by simply changing the oils we use in cooking. Just as with essential oils, many cooking oils are refined, adulterated, or too crude to enhance the functioning of the body. We need ghee or cold pressed oils. Cold pressed oils must be in containers that block UV light.
? Build healthy red blood cells by consuming lots of minerals. You need more than just iron.
? Consume anti-viral foods, herbs and spices.
? Consume pre-biotics, probiotics, cod liver oil
? 1 T. colloidal silver daily. See http://colloidalsilversecrets.blogspot.com/2014/03/does-colloidal-silver-boost-immunity.html
? 1 T. organic sulfur 2 x/day (virus's can't grow in an oxygenated environment). See 9.18 Additional products/Sulfur* p. 91 for how important it is to consume ½ your weight in ounces of water per day. Else the sulfur can't work!
? Improve lymphatic health. See 6.33 Lymph congestion p. 39
? Avoidance of risks/management of exposure
? Face masks with drops of essential oils/plastic gloves
? Limit being in crowds
? Precautionary measures in your own space
? Diffusing diffuser blend (in a nebulizing diffuser) Oils, when properly nebulized, leave a zone of inhibition, meaning that if a viable organism falls on such a surface, it would probably either die or be drastically restrained.
? Your place should be clean, certain pathogens grow best in dust, cold, damp, etc. At the same time too much cleaning can be bad. If you diffuse in your kitchen, then wipe your counter, your counter is not so protected. Consider running your diffusing during and after cleaning.
? Spraying colloidal silver and/or some essential oils on your HEPA furnace filter. Or simply putting a cotton ball with some essential oils in your cold air return.
* Be prepared if you should get Ebola
? Potent protection, Indigo drops, Sangre de grado
? Activated charcoal to absorb toxins produced by the virus
? Colloidal silver intake should be increased
* Ingrid
? Ebola is a hemorrhagic infection, like AIDS in some ways
? The Plague was a bacterial infection and Ebola is caused by a virus, most likely one engineered in laboratories.
? Ingrid's Potent Protection is possibly designed for today's new virus's
? Lomatium, a very potent anti-viral herb, as well as black cumin (Nigella sativa). See 7.4 Black cumin (Nigella sativa) p. 64
? Lomatium is in Ingrid's Indigo Drops. This makes more sense to me because there are countless symptoms that come with infections, such as swollen glands and morbid by-products of metabolic processes carried out by infectious organisms.
? “Good lipid membranes can protect red blood cells. I have not tested all oils, but I am 100% certain that ghee is superior to nearly every readily available commercial oil, including olive oil. However, I am willing to bet that some of the more exotic oils like black cumin seed oil and probably also the highly touted oils such as flax and evening primrose oil are also helpful, but I am just guessing. With ghee, I am not guessing; I am sure.”
? Sangre de grado because it is hemorrhagic. See 7.41 Sangre de Grado (Dragon's Blood)* p. 72
? Cat's claw and jergon sacha because Ebola is like AIDS in some ways 
? When fighting an infection, the greater problem is the toxicity generated from the microorganisms, not the microorganisms themselves (think charcoal).
* Steve Barwick (www.TheSilverEdge.com)
? At most, all you can do is extrapolate from the study that since nanosilver stopped the Ebola virus (and several other hemorrhagic fever viruses) from replicating in cell cultures under laboratory conditions, it just *might* work, too, under real-life conditions, but that this remains to be proven. 
? Should Ebola actually ever come to this country and present a threat it would appear your chances against infection would be better if you were already using silver than if you started using it after coming into contact with an infected individual.
* Do not take the vaccine!
1.56.4. Enterovirus 68
* Leading up to the virus
? See Calcarea carbonica 30C
* Remedies if the virus is occurring
? Because wheezing is the most significant aspect of Enterovirus 68, a homeopathic specific to that symptom must be chosen.
? Kali iodatum 6C is my pick for a wheezing condition. And I’d administered it every 3 hours during a crisis. 
? If a dry cough accompanies this, I’d consider Ipecacuanha 30c every 3 hours as well. And as usual in an acute illness, the remedies should be stopped once improvement is well established. This might be a day or so up to many days.
? These are my go-to medicines for not only this particular virus but also for wheezing and/or this specific type of coughing under nearly any condition.
1.56.5. Shingles
* Olive leaf extract. See 7.32 Olive leaf extract p. 70
* Homeopathy Antimonium crud 6
1.57  Vomiting
* Take charcoal immediately. See 9.1 Charcoal* p. 81
* Try to determine the cause
? See 6.27 Hyperthermia p. 37
? See 6.24 Fever p. 35
1.58  Warts
* Warts are caused by a virus, and their appearance may indicate a lowered immune system, so by overtly removing them, the problem is far from gone.
* The presence of warts may indicate a deeper illness, possibly even something that has been suppressed.
* Simply removing the warts by the slash and burn method does not correct the underlying weakness.
* As per the Banerji Protocols, here are methods I observed in Calcutta:
? Antimonium crud 6 mixed with Arsenicum album 200 every other day.
? For those cases that do not respond to this protocol, especially for warts that are fleshy, soft and sometimes situated on a stalk, Thuja occidentalis 30, taken twice per day.
? In addition to taking Thuja orally, you can make a tincture and apply to the wart several times daily.
1.59  Water 
* General notes
? Bottled water is only as safe as the source. Plastic is always less desirable (for environmental reasons and and because it leaches toxicity into it’s contents)
? If getting water from nature, look for clean flowing streams.
? If water is cloudy, see if you can filter it with sometime like a cloth before proceeding with a treatment method. 
* Sport Berkey
? See 9.17 Sport Berkey* p. 91
* Oil of oregano 
? 4 drops per 8 oz. cup
? No need to wait, the oil is for your stomach, not to purify the water. Oil and water will never mix
* See 9.3 Colloidal silver* p. 85
* Heat
? Bring water to a boil and allow it to cool to room temperature (do not add ice). 
? Water is purified when kept at 150F for 6 minutes (this requires less energy than bringing it to a boil)
* Sun
? Leave in sun for a few hours in a single serving water bottle 
? Lay bottle on it’s side for greatest exposure
? Done in third world counties
* Carbonated water is acidic enough (due to the dissolved carbon dioxide) to kill most contaminating bacteria. 
* Ferment with kombucha or water kefir
* Lugols
? Solution 5%—use 4 drops/liter or 1 drop/cup

Disinfecting Contact TimesWater ClarityWater Temperature40°F60°FClear30 min15 minCloudy60 min30 min
? In a hurry you may double the chemicals and half the waiting time. 
? To prevent overdosing on Lugols, half the treatment dose and double the waiting time.
? Be careful to avoid too many consecutive days of the iodine.
1.60  Wounds, abrasions
* Control bleeding (some bleeding is good, as bleeding helps to clean out a wound)
? If bleeding is severe, cover the wound with powders
? Clay or charcoal. 
? Cayenne or turmeric 
? Yarrow—pack wound with fresh or dried leaves and flowers from a yarrow plant. See 7.49 Yarrow*+ p. 75
? Cover wound with dressing and apply pressure 
? Elevate the wound above the level of the heart
* Once bleeding has stopped, clean wound (do not wait an hour for medical help, clean immediately and then clean again when medical help arrives. If you wait an hour, the wound will have started to heal over and toxins will be trapped). Also, if you think there might be glass or gravel tapped inside the wound, have an x-ray taken to be sure there is nothing!
? Rinse with running water. 
? Water from your water bottle may have to do.
? A syringe may be best. These are great for cleaning a wound under pressure to clear out any foreign bodies or dirt.
? Then clean wound and surrounding area with soap—e.g. Dr. Bronner’s all-in-one. Also use something antiseptic such as oil of oregano. It will sting a bit.
? Then rinse well with plain water
? Depending on the wound and it’s location, it is recommended to soak it in room temperature activated charcoal water to remove toxins.
? The best way to avoid later problems is a clean wound. See 6.46 Staph, MRSA, sepsis p. 48
* If a simple soap and water cleaning didn’t do the job...
? Use sterilized tweezers to remove any dirt that remains in the wound after washing. 
? Or better yet, apply charcoal patch or poultice. Mostly likely it will get out impurities which tweezers can’t.
* From Brighten Baby
1. Immediately after you experience a surface wound, clean the wound out with one or more of the following: antibiotic ointment, hydrogen peroxide, calendula tincture, an iodine swab, or basic soap and water.
2. Then, apply a nano-silver gel to the wound.
3. Once the nano-silver has dissolved, apply a vitamin A or vitamin E cream directly to the wound.
4. Throughout the day, spray Original Quinton (Isotonic or Hypertonic) into the wound.
5. Then, at least once daily, apply hot castor oil packs on top of the wound.
6. Repeat steps 1–5 daily until the wound heals.
7. Take chymotrypsin and silkworm derived serrapeptase (two proteolytic enzymes) immediately after and for several weeks to prevent scar tissue formation.
* If a minor scrape...
? Apply antiseptic. Put oil of oregano on cloth or apply directly to open wound. It will sting a bit, but a 10 second sting is better then an infection.
? Apply Manuka honey twice per day. Keep it constantly moist with honey for optimal healing. Hydrated skin heals faster than dry skin. See 9.11 Manuka honey* p. 89
* If major...
? Consider Arnica 200C immediately. Do not apply Arnica cream until the wound has healed 
? If injury is on the arms, remove any rings below the injury
? See 6.51 Sprains, strains, breaks, bruises p. 50 (they are probably involved as well)
? See these amazing charcoal wound healing stories (with pictures) and you will be motivated to use charcoal—http://www.buyactivatedcharcoal.com/wounds
? Sangre de grado (http://zerorads.com/zerorads_store/blood_support.php)—It makes an excellent natural sterile bandage, no bleeding, stitches, scars, and usually no pain either. Can be used immediately, even when blood is gushing. It is used for huge machete wounds and gun shots. The other one that stops bleeding immediately is Yunnan Baiyao. (Ingrid Nairman)
? A bad wound may require systemic treatment as well (oil of oregano can usually be substituted for antibiotics). However, if you are using homeopathy, the strong smell of oil or oregano will antidote the remedy.
? Drink like of bone broth to help the tissue repair. When doctors perform surgery and WAPF patients drink lots of bone broth, they heal in ½ the time. Consider putting Great Lakes Gelatin in your bone broth, basically making it double strength.
? See 9.18 Sulfur* p. 91—take double does. It helps the body mend. Also consume high doses of vitamin C (acerola powder, rose hip tea, etc.) In addition to working synergisticly with sulfur, it is anti-infection (tetanus)
? If possible, you want to avoid a tetanus shot. Doctor's over-prescribe them. Be prepared to say “no thank you” to the doctor. Get the wound scrupulously clean (RIGHT AWAY), give you body supplements and rest. See 6.55 Tetanus (lockjaw) p. 53
? Observe your wound, it should be getting better daily.
* If infected (red, hot, inflamed)...
? You do NOT want to seal in the infection with oil, honey or comfrey.
? You want to draw out the infection with clay, charcoal or plantain
* If stitches might be needed (a deep cut that seems to pull apart)...
? You need to have them done within the first 24 hours of the incident. 
? Apply Steri-Strips
? How to apply Steri-Strips
? Clean and dry skin at least 3 inches around the wound
? Line up skin edges. At midpoint of the wound, apply one-half of the first strip up to the wound edge and pres firmly into place. Without applying tension to the strip, press the free half firmly into place.
? Apply additional closures at approximately 1/8 inch intervals as needed to complete dressing.
? How to remove Steri-Strips
? Gently grasp the edge and slowly lift the closure from each end, up to the wound site. Carefully lift the strip away from the wound surface. 
? Do not lift off the closure from one end only or wound may reopen.
* See 6.45 Scars p. 47
 2  Essential oils, herbs, teas
2.1  Algonquin drops
* http://www.cancersalves.com/pdf/Algonquin_Drops.pdf
* To address this vaccinal taint, Dr. Jones often administered “cancer drops” to his patients. The drops contained baptisia (wild indigo), phytolacca (poke root), and Thuja occidentalis.
? Baptisia is anti-infective. 
? Poke is a major decongestant for the lymphatic system; and 
? Thuja was, as noted, used to antidote the negative effects of vaccines. 
* Jones recommended that patients take five drops every three (waking) hours. This was used in addition to homeopathic remedies, but the drops are standard herbal tinctures, not homeopathic.
2.2  Asafoetida/Hing*
* Used in almost all Indian vegetarian cooking 
* Asafoetida is one of the key digestion promoting herbs of the Ayurvedic tradition; it is also antispasmodic and expectorant. This is a spicy and very fragrant herb reminiscent of garlic; like garlic, it is rich in healthful sulfur compounds. Asafoetida is considered a stimulant, not only to the digestion, but also to the respiratory system and the nervous system (but calms nervousness). Further, it is an aphrodisiac (in laboratory studies, it has been compared favorably to sildenafil, known by the brand name Viagra). Asafoetida is obtained from the juice of the plant; it is fried before use (otherwise it is irritating). For digestive complaints, it is relied upon to improve the "digestive fire" and thereby speed the digestion of food, alleviating problems of heaviness, fullness, bloating, or gas after eating. By improving the digestion, asafoetida helps prevent the formation of excess phlegm and ama.17
2.3  Astragalus*
* To strengthen immunity and assist the body with preventing colds, the flu and other illnesses. However, according to Chinese tradition, astragalus SHOULD NOT be taken during the early stage of infections. Its greatest effects are preventative.
* Have it two weeks before travel. 20–30 grams in water per day. Or make it in chai
* Cooked into soup or rice, has a sweet taste
* Regain white blood cell count after chemo
2.4  Black cumin (Nigella sativa)
* This remarkable "black seed" has a very rich traditional history over the centuries because of its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti inflammatory properties. The seed contains over 100 compounds, including many vitamins and minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. 
* See http://www.naturalnews.com/038854_black_cumin_healing_compounds_disease_prevention.html
* It has a spicy, pungent, nutty flavor and aroma, and is commonly used in ethnic foods, herbal teas, candies, and liquors. 
2.5  Black walnut
* Ingrid says it may be useful for parasite when taken between ParaPro rounds
* Black walnut has been shown to be more effective against Candida than any antiviral drug. It can be taken in capsule form or as an extract.
2.6  Boneset tea
* There’s an interesting thing about boneset tea. If you drink it while you are healthy you will probably hate it. It is disastrously and amazingly bitter. Even if you think you love bitters, you will most likely detest this. 
* However, if you sip boneset tea while you are feverish and your body is full of the aches and pains of the fever process you will probably come to adore this tea and the amazing relief that it brings. I’ve had several people say it tastes entirely different while sick. Still bitter, but much more pleasant. 
* Because boneset is so very bitter, if you drink too much of it too quickly it can make you nauseous or even vomit. I suggest drinking the warm tea in frequent but small sips while you have a fever with aches and pains. I generally recommend it as a simple, but it could be blended with other relaxing diaphoretic herbs like elderflowers. 
* Ingredients
? 10 grams of boneset leaf (Eupatorium perfoliatum)
? 1 pint of just-boiled water
* Steep the boneset in the water for 10–20 minutes. Strain.
* Drink in small frequent sips.
* Decrease the frequency of your sips if you feel queasy at all.
2.7  Calendula tincture
* Joette likes it for cleaning wounds
2.8  Cat's claw (Una de Gato)
* Traditionally in Peruvian medicine for the treatment of a wide range of health problems, particularly digestive complaints and arthritis and to treat wounds, stomach problems, cancer, and more. It has become one of the best selling herbs in the USA.
* Exerts powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that support DNA repair, joint health, immune function, and normal cell division
* Candida, fungal issues
* Viral/Ebola (Ingrid)
* As more and more studies are being conducted, interest in cat's claw has come to include AIDS (in conjunction with Jergon Sacha) and Lyme disease
* The two known species of cat’s claw are Uncaria guianensis, used traditionally for wound healing, and Uncaria tomentosa, which has numerous medicinal uses and is most commonly found in supplements. 
* The typical dosage of a cat’s claw preparation is up to 350 mg daily, standardized to contain 8% carboxy alkyl esters. It is safe in the recommended doses; side effects are usually associated with possible allergic reactions to plants in the Rubiaceae family.
2.9  Cayenne*
* Hot!
* Dramatically increases circulation, sweat it out.
* Helps with sore throat at onset, gets things running
* Can use the powder to stop any bleeding wounds
* Has been known to stop heart attacks within 30 seconds (a teaspoon of Cayenne extract in a glass of hot water every 15 minutes until the crisis has passed.)
* Cayenne tea
? Ingredients
? ¼ t. cayenne powder (or more or less)
? 1 T. lemon juice
? 1 t. honey
? 8 oz. Of hot water
? Place the cayenne powder in a cup. Pour the just-boiled water over it. Stir. 
? Add the lemon juice and honey. Stir. Sip slowly once it has cooled. The hotter you drink this the better. 
2.10  Chamomile*
* Stress, calming, digestive
* Make stronger for sleep
2.11  Cinnamon*
2.12  Cleavers+
* Makes a potent lymphatic tea (according to Ingrid and muscle tested by Hannah)
* Cleavers are easy to grow, harvest in the spring
2.13  Cloves*
* 18“Natures pharmacy”
* Warming, antibacterial and antiseptic properties.
* For those who easily get cold inside the body, this herb increases internal heat, dispels internal chill and strengthens metabolism and circulation. Clove strengthens stomach functions, and restores, nourishes, and supports the entire body; it exerts a gently strengthening effect on the body. It even expels or repels intestinal worms.
2.14  Comfrey*
* Knits together bruises, but be careful, it works so well it can seal in infections (or stitches)
* Good for sprains
* Comfrey is also great for healing broken bones. Again, it’s so good at this that it is cautioned not to use comfrey on a broken bone unless the bone has been set. Otherwise it could heal the bones out of place. 
* A poultice
? Begin by chopping up the comfrey leaves. They can be a bit pokey so you may want to wear gloves. Mince them well. 
? Using a mortar and pestle (or simply using a sturdy wooden spoon in a bowl) mash the comfrey leaves until they form a paste. You can also put them in a blender or food processor. 
? You want to end up with a paste of comfrey leaves. 
? Place this over the desired area. Wrap an old t-shirt or something similar around the poultice. Secure it with tape. 
? This can be changed up to three times a day. 
? To freeze comfrey poultices for later use, make the comfrey paste and then put it in a ziplock or tupperware in the freezer. Refresh each growing season. 
2.15  Diffuser Blend*
* Ingrid's (better than thieves)
* Not intended for internal use or for inhalation therapy. It is intended for use in spaces that have been largely decontaminated, meaning that obvious signs of mold have been removed and one next wants to create the inhibition to discourage any return of mold. If no one is in the room, and this includes pets, the diffuser can be operated for hours at a time unless the air in the room is picked up by the air returns and circulated through the entire house or building. 
* Intended for industrial use, not personal use. The reason is that the oils are very intense and there is too much eucalyptus for prolonged personal use.
* Intended for use in rooms that have a history of mold. When used over a period of weeks, the mist creates an invisible shield that inhibits mold growth. The spores may still be there, but the oils discourage the mold from becoming vegetative. Of course, the oils smell very nice so this blend can be used to improve the smell in a room. The oils can be inhaled but the recommended amount is 3–5 minutes of inhalation. This length of time is not adequate for mold protection so the rooms should be vacant most of the time when diffusing for hours or days on end.
2.16  Echinacea+
* Not for people with auto-immune issues
* Shortening duration of cold or flu.
* Take 20 drops every ½ hour if coming down with something.
* Take just 3 times/day if doing proactively
* Only take at the very onset. If you already have the full blown cold, don't bother.
* Roselee makes a ½ echinacea and ½ elderberry tincture which she takes proactively when she does high risk things such as get on a plane.
* Use at onset on cold/flu, not for the duration.
* Boils! (a hot condition, echinacea cools)
2.17  Elderberry+
* Wonderful, seemingly all-purpose herb for fevers, especially when the person feels hot and is not sweating. Even reduces the duration of colds and flus. 
* Rosalee de la Forêt’s go to for colds, flu and fevers
* With syrup, Rosalee took 4 quarts of syrup in 4 days when she felt she was coming down with something.
* Effective again at least 8 different viruses such as H1N1
* Take every ½ hour! It's just a food, so you really don't need to worry about overdosing.
* Can not eat the berries straight off the bush
* Need to heat, but not above 180
* A very old western tea recipe
? Mix:
? 1 part elderflower
? 1 part yarrow
? ½ part mint—peppermint, spearmint or even bee balm (Monarda fistulosa)
? ½ part rose hips
? Steep a ½ cup of the mixture in one pint of water for thirty minutes.
? Strain and then sip while warm. This tea is best sipped throughout the day rather than in one sitting. Rosalee takes 6–12 grams of tea per day
2.18  Elderflower tea*
* A very old western recipe that is considered a general formula for colds and the flu.
* Both elder flowers and yarrow are used as relaxing diaphoretics, making this blend especially well suited for people with fevers who feel hot and are restless.
* Peppermint (used to treat indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, colds, headache and cramps), spearmint, or even bee balm (Monarda fistulosa) are wonderful mints to use in this blend.
* Mix the following
? 1 part elder flower
? 1 part yarrow (leaf and flower)
? ½ part mint
? ½ part rose hips
* To make the tea, steep ½ cup of the mixture in one pint of water for thirty minutes. Stain and then sip while warm.
2.19  Eucalyptus
* A favorite remedy for a sore throat, wheezing or anything related to bronchial or sinus distress.
* The vapors, when inhaled soothe the respiratory tract and kill the bacteria that are harbored there
2.20  Fennel*
* Especially for gas and bloating, but also for general digestion
2.21  Frankincense
* 19Universally good oil, similar to the all purpose lavender
2.22  Garlic
* Can cure every disease, except the disease it creates, bad breath (ha ha)
* To prepare the most potent garlic...
? Mince the cloves. Let stand for 15 minutes.
? Mix wit butter/oil and eat on bread/veggies
? Want to get the most in without getting nauseous
* Circulation, anti-microbial
* Take it pro-actively to avoid stomach issues
* Raw garlic is a powerful anti-fungal that does not destroy beneficial bacteria in the gut. It does, however, kill bad bacteria while killing 24 out of 26 strains of Candida. 
* It can also be rubbed on fungal skin infections.
* It can be eaten raw, taken in softgel capsules, or taken as an oil. Warning: can be a blood thinner. Do not use garlic if you plan to undergo surgery or if otherwise contraindicated.
2.23  Ginger*
* Ginger is one of our best polycrest herbs in that it can be used in a variety of ways for a variety of conditions. Because of its heating and drying qualities, it is best used for people with signs of coldness and dampness. Ginger especially affects the respiratory system, digestive system, and circulatory system. It is a powerful anti-inflammatory shown to decrease pain for those with chronic inflammatory pain such as arthritis.
* What doesn't ginger do? Modulate inflammatory response, antimicrobial, stimulating diaphoretic (heats you up)
* Sore throat, motion sickness, digestion, nausea
* The sickness-reducing effects seem more pronounced when the ginger is taken along with some honey. Try chewing on a small piece of fresh ginger with a little honey.20
2.23.1. Ginger tea*
* Grate 1” fresh ginger (dry can also work)
* Put in thermos
* Add splash of lemon and and a little honey (and maybe a pinch of cayenne)
* Let sit for 15 minutes
* Sip slowly
2.24  Goldenseal
* Great for mucus membrane infections (when it can come in contact with those tissues)
? Chronic sinusitis/fungal issues
* Endangered, buy cultivated only
* Use mainly the rhizomes 
* Very cold, dry & astringent (at the onset, you actually don't want to dry up the mucus, it's beneficial)
2.25  Gotu kola (Centella asiatica) 
* has been used to treat many conditions for thousands of years in India, China, and Indonesia. It was used to heal wounds, improve mental clarity, and treat skin conditions such as leprosy and psoriasis. 
* Some people use it to treat respiratory infections such as colds, and in the past it was used for that in China. It has been called "the fountain of life" because legend has it that an ancient Chinese herbalist lived for more than 200 years as a result of taking gotu kola.
* Historically, gotu kola has also been used to treat syphilis, hepatitis, stomach ulcers, mental fatigue, epilepsy, diarrhea, fever, and asthma. Today, in the U.S. and Europe gotu kola is most often used to treat varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency, a condition where blood pools in the legs. It's also used in ointments to treat psoriasis and help heal minor wounds.
* See 9.6.2 Alakananda Ma's Rehydration Tea p. 87
2.26  Indigo drops*
* From Ingrid Naiman
* More potent than Cleavers tea. Cleavers tea is a lymphatic decongestant but it is also pH balancing. Most people who are toxic are too acidic. Even our water can be acidic. It should have a pH of 7.0 but I have tested some bottled water that had a pH as low as 4.5. This is horrifying. However, take that wretched water and use it to make Cleavers Tea, the pH will miraculously correct despite the starting point.
* Indigo Drops gets its name from "wild indigo", an adaptogenic plant with an affinity for the upper part of the body, especially the respiratory system. Indigo Drops is a potent antiviral and lymph stimulating formula.
* It was developed in response to needs for effective lymphatic relief where the cause of the congestion is presumed to be an underlying infection, often chronic and undiagnosed. It works best when combined with one of Ingrid's lymph stimulating teas.
2.27  Jergon Sascha
* Rain forest herb
* Used for viruses, such as HIV and hepatitus C, as well as venomous bites.
2.28  Lavender*
* The most versatile of all essential oil
* Relaxing and winding down before bedtime, yet has balancing properties that can also boost stamina and energy. 
* Soothe and cleanse common cuts, bruises, and skin irritations. Need to dilute with a carrier oil.
* Scent linens and repel moths and insects 
? Add a few drops of lavender essential oil to a cotton ball and place it in closets and drawers to scent linens and repel moths and insects.
* Flowers can be made into a pleasant tasting tea taken at night for sleeplessness or during the day for headaches and nervous tension
* Just smelling the oil can reduce stress
2.29  Lemon*
* Lemon helps the body remove toxins and is also an excellent tonic for both the liver and gall bladder. 
* Try a daily dose of an olive oil and lemon mixture during your cleanse:
? Blend an organic lemon, cut into pieces, with 1¼ cups spring water and a tablespoon of olive oil. Partially strain, leaving some pulp. 
? The pectin from the lemon peel also helps the digestive tract. 
? Drink before bed. In addition to supporting detoxification, many people report that this drink helps improve their sleep.
* Misc uses
? Remove gum, oil, grease spots, glue or adhesive, and crayon from most surfaces
? Use 1–2 drops of lemon essential oil 
? Cleanse and sanitize surfaces (such as counters and cutting boards)
* Combine 2–3 drops of lemon essential oil with water in a spray bottle to help 
? Hand sanitizer

2.30  Lemon balm+
* Rosalee's monograph—a plant for what ails ya 
* A mild spasmodic
* Tummy troubles
* Soothes the nerves and reduces anxiety 
* Combats viruses in the body
* Can be used like plantain for bites and strings. Also used for chicken pox eruptions
* Its delicious taste let’s us enjoy it for enjoyment’s sake 
2.31  Nettle leaf+
* Some natural doctors say this is the only herb needed for illness treatment. It contains large amounts of vitamins and trace minerals and helps the body stay hydrated and remove toxins. 
* In a tea with Red raspberry leaf, alfalfa and peppermint, it makes a powerful immune supporting and illness preventing remedy.
2.32  Olive leaf extract
* Ancient herbal remedy very similar and equally powerful healing properties as Lapacho.
* One particular ailment for which olive leaf extract has especially astounding and fast-acting effects-Shingles.21
2.33  Oregano oil*
* Oregano oil is a potent anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, anti-septic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory oil that can reduce pain and inflammation and effectively fight off infections. Recommend Healthy-Health Super Strength (it’s already diluted)
* Topical use
? Oil of oregano can be applied directly onto the skin to treat itches, skin infections, and irritated gums, but only if it has been diluted. 
? Hand disinfectant
? For emergency disinfecting (when disinfecting is urgent and it isn’t convenient or possible to wash hands). This is because you must be careful not to touch eyes, shake hands with others who might touch their eyes, etc.
? Keep away from eyes and sensitive areas.
* Internal use
? Dosing
? Take with or without food, without food. Taking without food is slightly better as none is taken away by the food. Best to wait 15 minutes before eating.
? For general prevention: 1–4 drops once a day 
? For high risk prevention (e.g. Zimbabwe): 4 drops, 4–6 times per day.
? For general malaise: 4 drops 1–3 times a day for as many days as you feel you need to.
? For acute conditions: 4 drops, initially take every hour. Don’t worry, you can’t overdose.
? Blood issues
? Sub-lingually provides faster absorption, going straight into the blood-stream. Try to hold under the tongue for 20 seconds, then chase with juice or water, if necessary. May be mixed with coconut or olive oil and rubbed on the bottoms of feet, which also gets the oil into the blood stream. The latter is effective, but less so than the sublingual method.
? Digestive issues
? The high concentrations of thymol and carvacrol in oil of oregano have been shown to calm upset stomachs and aid digestion.
? The oil needs to go to your stomach, not your blood, so you take it with just a little bit of food. A glass or milk or juice mixed with 2–3 drops of the oil is a quick home remedy for mild indigestion. 
? Sinus congestion 
? Oil of oregano has long been regarded as a natural remedy for sinus or lung congestion. 
? Sub-lingual best, but a few drops mixed with water will also work. 
? Inhale 22
2.34  Pau d'Arco (Lapacho)
* Commonly applied in treatment of cancer, AIDS, and Candida Albicans overgrowth and other fungal problems as well as many other diseases of the immune system Moreover, Lapacho is highly valued for its ability to detoxify the body, particularly the liver, kidneys, and intestinal tract. It also helps babies cope with food allergies and intestinal cramps.... 
* Many medical doctors and dental surgeons now routinely prescribe Lapacho to their patients for infection instead of giving them antibiotics.
* Pau d'arco is highly effective against Candida; it both inhibits and destroys Candida.
* Use as a tea, as capsules, or as a tincture.
* Dosage: To strengthen the immune system, drink 2–3 cups each day. For infection/inflammation, cancers, or other serious illnesses, double the dosage.
2.35  Passionflower+
* Hannah really likes it for sleep. More gentle than valerian
2.36  Peppermint*+
* Freshen breath
* Relieve colic, gas, heartburn, and indigestion
? Inhale or rub a drop on to your abdomen
? Add a drop of peppermint essential oil to herbal tea
* Reduce fever
? Rub on bottoms of feet, back of neck, left wrist
* Colds/Congestion
? Massage 2–3 drops (along with a carrier oil) onto chest or drop into a humidifier to help clear sinus and lung congestion.
? If you're head is feeling stuffed or you can't stop coughing, try a steam. See 5.9 Essential oils p. 17
* Headaches
? Rub one drop of peppermint essential oil on the temples, forehead, over the sinuses (careful to avoid contact with your eyes), and on the back of the neck
* Motion sickness and nausea
? Inhale
* Hives, inflammation and sore muscles
* Increase mental accuracy (concentration and alertness)
? Place 2 drops of peppermint essential oil on the tongue and rub another drop of oil under the nose (inhaling)
2.37  Plantain+
* Known for poultice making to heal bites, strings, cuts, and in general draw things our. It also comes in handy for minor wounds, burns, sores, ulcers, boils, blisters, broken bones, bruises, infected tooth root, respiratory problems, diaper rash, skin irritation, reducing scarring, and removing splinters and glass shards
* The nice thing about plantain is that it's always only a few steps away. It grows everywhere.
? Be sure the plantain isn't treated with chemicals. 
? The easiest way to identify plantain (of either type) is that it has leaves with parallel veins. 
? Most plants have leaves with veins that fork outward from a central midrib. Plantain, on the other hand, has side veins and a midrib which all run parallel to one another down to the base of the plant.
? Plantain doesn't have showy flowers, but it does have a distinctive, compact seed head that turns from green to brown as the seeds mature. All parts of the plant, including the seeds, are edible.
* The easiest way to make a plantain poultice is to chew up the leaf, put it on the wound, and cover it with a band-aid to hold it in place.
? Saliva actually contains many antibacterial properties (which may be why animals lick their wounds). 
? Ideally the injured person should chew his/her own leaves so that some of the juices are also internally ingested. 
? If a "spit poultice" is not for you, you can chop plantain with a knife or in the blender with a little water.
? As the plantain dries out, reapply a fresh poultice with new leaves that are chewed and moistened
2.38  Potent Protection*
* Ingrid's
* Potent Protection is slightly more similar to the formula left by the thieves; but let's say it was loosely inspired by their recipe, definitely not a knock off of the historic formula. Why is the question? Why didn't I just copy the famous recipe? The reason is that I have been obsessed by epidemics and have been researching them for decades. I am convinced that germs themselves change and people who survive epidemics pass on genes that confer some level of protection for future generations
* Potent Protection is not specific for any one condition. It is a "Potent" immune enhancing formula but it is not specific for any particular condition.
* Take only when symptoms are occurring
2.39  Rose hips*+
* Rosalee: I love infusing fresh rose hips into honey. You need to take out all the seeds and hairs from the hips first which can take awhile but the end result is delicious!
2.40  St. John's Wort
* Great for nerve pain, cold sores
2.41  Sangre de Grado (Dragon's Blood)*
* http://www.naturalnews.com/026764_sangre_de_drago_medicinal_power.html
* The tree’s red dark sap is known for its healing properties and the people of the Amazon refer to it as the “liquid bandage” because of its ability to heal wound, cuts, bites, rashes and other skin problems. They consider it to be the most valuable “first aid” substance thanks to its broad range of remedies.
* Throughout history the resin has been used by the Greek and Roman soldiers to heal and rapidly close their wounds and most likely since the beginning of time it was applied externally and taken internally by the native inhabitants of the Amazon jungle to help with ulcers, diarrhea and hemorrhoids.
* Ingrid uses it to stop bleeding. It's so powerful, it even works for a gunshot wound. She says it belongs in absolutely every medicine cabinet and backpack.
* Excellent for acne and skin issues, reproduces collagen. 
* Internally, heals and repairs the gut (Ulcers, Gastrointeritis & Other Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract). One half teaspoon, 3 times per day, for up to 12 days or "until cured."
2.42  Thieves*
* Do not take internally. Diffuse only
* Use Potent Protection, it's even better. See 7.38 Potent Protection* p. 72
* If cost is a factor, make your own thieves following the recipe on the Mountain Rose Herbs website. This can be added to hand soaps, etc. http://mountainroseblog.com/thieves-oil/
? 40 drops organic Clove Bud essential oil
? 35 drops organic Lemon essential oil 
? 20 drops organic Cinnamon Bark essential oil 
? 15 drops organic Eucalyptus essential oil
?  10 drops organic Rosemary essential oil 
2.43  Thyme*+
* Many of us think of thyme as simply a culinary herb, but thyme has a well-deserved place in our medicine cabinet as well. Thyme tea is fabulous for lung congestion and coughs. Rosalee's used it for productive coughs (to loosen and expel mucous) as well as for dry spasmodic coughs (to lessen the cough). 
* Antimicrobial in nature, it has been used for centuries to clean wounds and kill parasitic fungi on the skin. These antimicrobial properties make it great for cleaning your house as well
2.44  Tulsi* 
* Antioxidant—fights free-radical damage
* Antibacterial—helps ward off infection
* Anti-inflammatory
* Immune system modulator—aids in balancing and improving the immune response of the body to disease-causing elements, such as bacteria, viruses, allergens, and parasites.
* One of the most effective adaptogens discovered thus far
? Helps the body adjust to different types of stressors (poor lifestyle habits, emotional difficulties, environmental toxins, mental stress), and it does so differently for each person, depending on his or her needs
* Headache, heart disease, and stomach problems
* Tea is delicious, can also eat the fresh leaves off the plant
2.45  Triphala*
* Rosalee de la Forêt’s go to for constipation
* The most famous and most used of Ayurvedic formulas.
* About
? Both nourishing and detoxifying. It gently supports regular bowel movements, supports liver function while also providing adaptogenic properties.
? Triphala contains three tropical fruits used to regulate and regenerate the lower intestine. It is not a laxative or purgative but rather a support to deeper assimilation and elimination. It is balancing for all doshas.
? The generic Ayurvedic formula for colon cleansing is triphala, a combination of three tropical fruits, all of which are excellent antioxidants, free radical scavengers, and even parasiticides. Triphala is not a laxative, it is more of a roto rooter and works on arteries and other conduits in the body, not just the intestinal tract. It is as useful for people at risk of heart disease as for those with known intestinal problems.
? Improvements in hair and nail growth as well as skin luster normally do not become visible for 2–3 months following commencement of rejuvenating herbs because deeper regeneration takes precedence over more superficial rejuvenation. Triphala is a highly valuable formula for people who have suffered colon damage due to diet, infection, parasites, or even antibiotic use. However, it does not usually make an adequate substitution for laxatives though increasing the dosage sometimes helps.
? Amla is one of the best herbs in the world for rejuvenation. It is the main ingredient in the famous Chyawanprash formula as well as many other tonics. It has antitumoral properties, immune enhancing properties, and is also cardioprotective and hepatoprotective, all-in-one. 
? Haritaki is used in preparation for rejuvenation. It is a strong parasiticide and can be purgative in high doses. It is the strongest antioxidant of the three fruits and is useful for removing toxins and building blood. 
? Bibhitaki is more astringent and prevents fluid loss.
* It is recommended to drink it with juice or to place honey on the tongue before swallowing. While it is possible to find triphala in pill form, the powder is more effective and can be mixed in a small amount of cold or warm water or simmered and drunk as a medicinal tea. When used as a digestive tonic or laxative, it is best taken in the evening, about two hours after eating, and at least 30 minutes before bedtime. No food should be eaten for one and a half hours after ingestion.23
* 1–6 grams taken at night. Commonly taken as a powder stirred into hot water.
2.46  Turmeric*
* Traditionally, turmeric has been used to treat jaundice and other liver problems, promote circulation, dissolve blood clots, relieve the pain of arthritis and rheumatism, and cure diarrhea, sinus congestion, and ear infections.
* Turmeric's antiseptic properties can provide relief for stomach and diarrhea issues. Not only will the spice fight bacteria that have already set up shop, but it can be taken preventatively as well. A diet with even moderate doses of turmeric can help keep your system working properly. 
* Add generous amounts of turmeric to your cooked foods every day. To get the most out of your turmeric add 3% black pepper to the mix. Black pepper improves the bioavailability of turmeric, making smaller doses more effective.
* Aside from eating curry, there are a few other ways to take turmeric. The simplest method involves mixing a single teaspoon of the spice with a glass of warm water. Some people prefer mixing it with milk or yogurt
* However, be careful with quantity. A large amount of turmeric can cause digestive upset and diarrhea 
* See 9.10 Golden milk p. 89
* Turmeric can be applied externally (as a paste) to help heal hemorrhoids, wounds, cuts, and burns.
2.47  Valerian
* Great for sleep (in 90% of people), in the other 10% it has the opposite effect. Just take a dropper full of tincture.
* Also great as an anti-spasmotic (for things such as minstrel cramps and restless leg)
2.48  Wu yang patches
* From Chinese medicine, takes away all kinds of pain—bruises and structural, including back pain
* Has a strong scent, peel the back off and stick it on you.
* In stores and on the Internet, they don't disclose the exact formula
2.49  Yarrow*+
* Easy (and prolific) to grow
* Rosalee de la Forêt says if she were stuck on an dessert island with only one herb, this would be it.
* Uses
? Heals and disinfects wounds, relieves the pain associated with the wound, and stops bleeding
? Pack the wound with bruised leaves—mash with hands, use mortar and pestle or blender, or have injured person chew the leaves in their mouth
? Stops external bleeding—hemorrhoids, cuts, scrapes, post-partum care, bruises, and even sores found in the mouth.

3.3  Singles
3.3.1. Aconitum nap (Aconite) 30* 200*
* 25For injuries with a quick and abrupt start
* Aconite should be your first thought for shock of any kind. Ninety percent of all shock issues will be benefited by this remedy. It is great for shock from an injury (especially to the eye), but it can also ease the shock of surgery, the shock of exposure from a cold wind or the shock of witnessing a severe accident or a catastrophe.
* I like to use the term “Quick Shock” to characterize Aconite. When a loved one’s symptoms come on quickly, with gusto and intensity, Aconite is the best-matched remedy. In addition to its use for traditional shock symptoms, it is also useful for high fevers that come on quickly, especially if also accompanied by agitation, for colds and flu of sudden onset (especially after exposure to a cold wind), for laryngitis and for anxiety (both minor and extreme). Aconite has been known to abort pneumonia if given within the first 24–48 hours after the onset of symptoms.
* For any blow to the eyes, Aconite will ease the pain, keep infection from ensuing and minimize the potential for permanent eye injury. It is sometimes called the “Arnica of the eye.”
* Calms fears with any type of panic component. This includes fear of death, fear of darkness or a sense of impending doom.
* For help with panic, exposure to extreme cold, carbon monoxide poisoning and even apparent death, such as a severe electrical shock or suffocation. Remember: the common theme of problems calling for Aconite is sudden and shocking, making this a handy remedy to carry with you at all times.
* Also fear, chills, colds, cough, eye pain, dizziness 
* When it comes to the pain, swelling and shock of a sprained ankle and most sports injuries, this is a rewarding first choice. It should be administered orally as soon as possible and from every few minutes for more severe injuries to once daily for minor ones, say the homeopathic physicians. This method is the rule of thumb for the administration of homeopathic remedies in general.
3.3.2. Apis mellific 30C* 200C*
* If Ledum doesn’t reduce the pain, swelling and any other symptoms of insect bites after at least 3 doses, Apis may be the correct remedy for the situation.
3.3.3. Arnica montana 30C* 200C*
* Mountain daisy
* Uses
? The premiere remedy for injuries, especially to soft tissue and to the head and any stress injury to the limbs. Use 200C for head injuries. It reduces pain and inflammation, helps control bleeding, eases the effects of shock and shortens the healing time. At the first indication of an injury, the first step is to administer Arnica montana. 
? Exceeded your limits (not enough sleep, moved too much mulch) 
? Muscle pains from flu 
* Moves blood to heal tissues
* Internally
? Take 200C for the first day of your injury. Then take 30C for the next week. 
? Although it is prudent to begin as soon as possible, even if this first step is delayed, Arnica can still be effective when taken days later.
? Take 4–6 dose per day.
* Topically
? Apply gel or cream topically (only after wound has healed). Get 6C. Can not be used over broken skin
3.3.4. Arsenicum album 30X* 200C
* See animal bites
* For true food poisoning such that causes chills, stomach pains and anxiety then Arsenicum album 30 should be taken. This is best saved for when your turkey is tainted. Great for travel and gastroenteritis
3.3.5. Belladonna 30C 200C
* For cutting, throbbing, shooting, sharp pains, particularly if accompanied by redness. 
* It is also used for high fevers and is a top remedy for teething. 
* See 6.49 Sore throat p. 49
* The sufferer often has cold hands and feet and craves lemons or lemonade.
3.3.6. Bellis perennis 30C*
* Bellis is similar to Arnica but deeper acting.
* Joette's second favorite remedy for common injuries is Bellis. This remedy is made from the common daisy and is nearly comparable to Arnica in handling joint injuries, sprains, bruises and lacerations. In fact, Arnica is often administered first for the initial trauma, and Bellis is put to work after Arnica’s work is done. Often called the “internal Arnica,” Bellis is very good for suspected bruising to an internal organ. It is also used for rheumatism, abscesses, and interestingly, for anxiety before and after surgery.
* If Arnica doesn't complete work and the lymph node swelling and the coldness are key characteristics try Bellis. 
* Indicated typically in soft tissue areas like the breast or abdomen, and by the way, is a great post-surgery remedy
* It is also ideal for facilitating recovery after childbirth and for mechanical injury to the breast after a mammogram or from a seat belt injury.
3.3.7. Bryonia alba 30C
* Indicated in cases of fractures, sprains, dislocations, etc. Pain is always worse with movement and cold and improves with heat and pressure. Stiffness in the muscles and joints can be relieved with this remedy.
3.3.8. Calcarea carbonica 30C* 200C
* (Joette) In Calcutta, the Banerjis and their senior doctors use this method for their patients who are particularly susceptible to immunity-attacking viruses and bacteria.
* A daily immune booster. Can be employed for many months, but use it only for those members of your family who are susceptible to colds and with lowered immunity, not for those who have a respectable ability to fend off infections. 30C taken daily, 200C taken every other day.
* (WHC) Overwork, apprehension, back pain, bone pain, water retention 
3.3.9. Cantharis 30C* 200C
* A powerful remedy for burns. Whether the burn results from steam, exposure to chemicals, electrical shock or direct exposure to radiation, Cantharis can speed recovery, minimize the chance of infection and reduce the pain and swelling.
* For a first-degree burn, start with Aconite every 15 minutes for shock and pain. Stop after six doses. Then Cantharis can be given 4 times per day for the burn itself and may be used alternately with Aconite. In other words, on the hour give Aconite, on the half hour, give Cantharis. For second-degree and third-degree burns, Cantharis can be used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment. Cantharis is also helpful for sunburns.
3.3.10. Carbo vegetabilis 30C 200C*
* Prepared using charcoal and it is used to cure indigestion, flatulence and other health complaints. Recommended for chemo nausea.
3.3.11. Gelsemium sempervirens 30C*
* Muscular weakness, influenza (recommend by Joette Calabrese)
3.3.12. Hepar sulph 30
* See 6.49 Sore throat p. 49
3.3.13. Hypericum perforatum 30C* 200C*
* St. John's wort
* This is the premiere remedy for punctures, incisions, lacerations and penetrating wounds, especially in nerve-rich areas.
* Noted for nerve injury to any area including sciatica, disc compression, pinched nerves and even after dental work. It is also indicated for injuries to the head.
* When the pain is excessive and incredibly sensitive to touch, Hypericum may be the answer. It is excellent for injuries to the brain, to the back and spine and to the tailbone.
* An opportunity to augment the body’s ability to begin healing, reduce swelling, minimize potential infection and bring about calm. Hypericum is also used for injuries, particularly if the pain is nerve type pain, as when the pain is severe. Hypericum is a capital choice for tooth pain that originated in an inflamed nerve or after an extraction.
* Hypericum has also been known to prevent the onset of tetanus.
* See animal bites
3.3.14. Ignatia amara 30C*
* For grief, trauma and shock associated with disaster and loss or any acute emotional stress.
* This remedy is well suited for those who grieve the death of a loved one or suffer a broken heart or great disappointment. 
* It is Joettte's go-to remedy for depression. The person in need of Ignatia is usually reluctant to cry in front of others, is easily offended and very sensitive to reprimand and is inclined to audible sighing. 
* This remedy is great to have on hand for emotional stress that can accompany or follow injury or stress.
3.3.15. Ipecacuanha 30C*
* Nausea, wheezing, vomiting, difficult expectoration
* Vomiting is relentless and affords no relief after the episode
3.3.16. Kali iod 30C*
* The homeopathic preparation of Potassium iodide. To protect the thyroid from nuclear disaster. Also Glandular swellings and Syphilis
3.3.17. Ledum pall 30C* 200C
* Covers the reactions from the stings and bites of all bees, mosquitoes and ticks, as well as unidentified crawly creatures. It eliminates pain and the nasty swelling as well as remote swelling from allergic reactions. 
* Ledum has been shown to reduce the reaction even in an allergic person. In fact, in the compendium of homeopathic medical literature, it has been credited for having reversed anaphylaxis reactions.
* The premier remedy for any kind of animal bite.
* Think of it also for accidents from punctures, stabs, injury from an embedded nail, as well as bites from cats, rats, dogs and horses.
* This remedy can reduce swelling and inflammation. If the person is cold or the injury site feels cold to the touch, these are key indicators for Ledum.
* Give hourly or until the pain is minimized.
* Ledum has also been known to prevent tetanus.
* See also Apis
3.3.18. Nat phos 30C
* When there is simple indigestion and over acidity, then can be taken every hour. Use in place of antacids.
3.3.19. Nux vomica 30C 200C*
* “Over doing”
* Nausea 
* Over eating has caused nausea that you wish would just produce vomiting to get it over with, then your remedy is Nux vomica 30
* Hangovers—it will end nausea and vomiting in relatively short order.
* Kids worrying too much about exams
3.3.20. Phosphorus 30X* 30C
* See animal bites
3.3.21. Rhus tox 30C
* Dislocations, sprains, overuse and inflammation
* The “rusty gate” remedy and works best when muscles and joints are worse when immobile and creaky on first movement but improve with continued movement. 
* It is often the remedy of choice when muscles are overworked in the garden or after shoveling too much snow.
* 3–4 pellets of the 6X or 6C potency can be taken as often as every hour or two the day of the injury and 3–4 times a day after that. Rhus tox can be taken the same time as Arnica if needed.
3.3.22. Ruta grav 30C
* For complaints involving cartilage, tendons or bone bruises. 
* Is indicated for sprains, bone bruises or injuries to the cartilage, tendons or bone surfaces. 
* It is also used to stabilize a loose tooth and to relieve eye strain.
* It is also useful for pain from bunions. Consider Ruta for a feeling of bruised soreness and injuries to deep muscle tissues especially to the wrists and knees. 
* It is also effective for repetitive stress injuries such as golfer’s elbow, tennis elbow and carpal tunnel syndrome.
3.3.23. Silicea 30C*
* Expelling foreign objects from body (e.g. gravel). Also formation of pus, boils, confusion, constipation, itching overwork
3.3.24. Symphytum 30C
 4  Helps relieve pain and heal bones and cartilage quickly. Any bone injury, bone bruise, shin injury, facial injury to the eye or injury to the skull will improve with Symphytum. 
 5  Inflamed bone and even bone spurs or callouses can improve with the use of Symphytum.
5.1.1. Traumeel ointment
* A formula containing Arnica that can be used over broken skin 
5.2  Mix 'n match
* Banerji Protocols is to mix Symphytum 200 with Rhus tox 30, for overuse of muscles and arthritic pains.
* I have also found that alternating between two remedies provides a simple way to cover all the bases. So for example, when I fell on my head while skiing, I know that Hypericum helped me but not until after I had alternated between it and Arnica 200 for a few rounds.
? That is, I took Arnica 200 on the hour and Hypericum 200 on the half hour for a few hours and noted fairly soon after a few doses of each that the one that offered the best relief was Hypericum.
? Once that was established, I dropped the use of Arnica and stayed with Hypericum every hour or two. Perfect results. This is how we gain our ability to go to bigger and greater injuries with confidence.

6.1  Charcoal*
6.1.1. Essentials
* Clay vs. charcoal
? Charcoal has more drawing power than clay. Best for food poisoning and drawing toxins out of wounds
? You ate something with sugar, dyes, etc. that your body is reacting to, charcoal is best
? Charcoal is messier than clay—because it’s a finer powder
? To minimize mess, begin by putting water in the container, then gently spoon charcoal into the container (don’t pour). 
? Clay has minerals to offer the body where charcoal has none.
? Activated charcoal does not adsorb certain heavy metals very well or at all. How it adsorbs aluminum seems debatable. Hair analysis samples before and after activated charcoal therapy and have shown conclusively that it lowers mercury and lead.
* Activated charcoal is best, but any clean charcoal will do. Learn how to make your own charcoal from the remains of a fire.
* No charcoal, no problem, just use plantain. See 7.37 Plantain+ p. 71

6.1.2. Dry powder application
* See directly on wounds to control bleeding
6.1.3. Soaks and baths
* 30–60 minutes, the more severe the injury, the longer the recommended time
* Warm water is best, as the time goes along I add additional hot water to warm my soak
* 1–2 cups of charcoal powder to warm bathtub water and immerse body for up to one hour.
* ¼ cup of charcoal powder to a 2 gallon arm or foot soak
* See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24
6.1.4. Jelly poultice
* How to video—http://www.buyactivatedcharcoal.com/videos
* Poultice might be more effective if it is preceded by a soak.
* The poultice may be left on for several hours or overnight (overnight is best). Do not leave on for more than about 8 hours.
* A charcoal and flax or corn starch poultice may be placed over the liver at night to noticeably decrease the toxic load of the liver. Lab tests, performed after two weeks of nightly charcoal application, showed elevated liver enzymes decreased significantly. 
* Charcoal doesn’t seem to pull out petrochemicals such as kerosene and gasoline. For these, use clay. 
* Charcoal helps with the toxic metabolic products from parasites
* Directions for a large poultice
? Start with 1/4 cup water (or colloidal silver)
? Add 2 T. activated charcoal
? Add 2 T. of ground flaxseed [Flax can be used as a topical demulcent (to soften) and emollient (to soothe). It can also be used as a poultice on the skin to heal inflammation.] 
? Cornstarch can be used instead of flaxseed, but it doesn't have the healing properties of flax. 
? Stir gently with spoon
? Set aside for 10–20 minutes to thicken, or heat mixture and allow to cool
? Spoon onto center of paper towel
? Fold paper towel—North, East, West, South
? The charcoal should start seeping through the bottom of the paper towel.
? Place on injury (with the bottom of the paper towel on the injury). It's good to treat anywhere around the injury where there is swelling.
? Cover with plastic (saran wrap, piece of plastic bag, etc.)
? Hold in place with an ace bandage
6.1.5. Patch
* How to video—http://www.buyactivatedcharcoal.com/videos
* Preferred method, but you need the psyllium so that the charcoal will hold together in a ball and then roll out and not crack.
* It takes a bit more prep time, but ultimately time is saves time because you can make several poultices at once and store in the freezer.
* Charcoal lays directly against your skin. Conforms well to your body.
* Recipe 
? Ingredients 
? ½ t. ground psyllium husks (preferred), or 1 t. ground psyllium seed (psyllium was also used topically by herbalists to treat skin irritations, including poison ivy reactions and insect bites and stings. )
? 2 T. activated charcoal powder
? ¼ c. room temp water (or colloidal silver)
? Stir together (carefully) as the charcoal will want to leap out of leap out of the bowl. At first it will look like the charcoal is repelling the water. Just keep stirring. 1 minute.
? When it makes a paste and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (and turns into a gel/ball)
? Then remove and place between two pieces of plastic wrap (about 12” x 16”, smaller if you are making the charcoal thicker). Kimberly likes to put press and seal on the bottom (sticky side up with charcoal against it) and plain food wrap on top
? Roll out with a rolling pin or a large glass (if you don’t own a rolling pin), like you are rolling out pie dough. Roll to about 1/8 inch thick. 
? Do not use right away, freeze for at least 15 minutes
* Remove one of the pieces of plastic wrap and place that side against your body. Leave the plastic wrap on the side facing away from you (though you can trim the plastic so the edge is at the edge of the poultice.
* Cover plastic patch with a larger piece of plastic (so there is no leaking) and then wrap with an ace, or better yet, something that will stick to itself. The charcoal must be making contact with the skin to work.
* With something serious going on, keep the paste on the thick side.
* Patches can be frozen to have a ready supply on hand. When removing the patches from the freezer, let stand for a few minutes to soften. Then cut to the desired size and apply.
* They keep for at least 3 months in the freezer
* Patches are less bulky than poultices
6.1.6. Hydrated topical application
* This is the quickest method, but a poultice or patch will be effective for a longer time period. Especially if the charcoal is simply hydrated with water, it will dry out quickly.
* Mix the dry powder into a hydrated state. The majority of your ingredient should be charcoal
? Plain water (the other options make the topical application more medicinal)
? Colloidal silver
? Manuka honey
? Olive oil
* Spread paste directly onto the skin.
* Cover if you want to retain the moisture for longer
6.1.7. Charcoal water for internal use
* How to video—http://www.buyactivatedcharcoal.com/videos (Kimberly calls it a charcoal slurry drink)
* Dissolve 1–3 t. charcoal in 4 oz. of water followed by a cup of water—or simply mix charcoal with 12 oz. of water
* If the first dose of charcoal is vomited, give another dose immediately. Follow the dose of charcoal with a full glass of water if possible. Charcoal taken the third time usually stays down. If someone is in danger of vomiting, the head should be elevated.
* Ideally, take away from food (just like clay). However usually time is of the essence, and in that case charcoal should be taken immediately.
* Drink extra water, charcoal is constipating 26 27
* Be forewarned, the charcoal will likely turn your stools black. Notice the time from ingestion to the time your stools turned black. If it is more than 24 hours, you transit time is likely to long, and this is an issue worth looking into.
* Helps remove toxins so your body can concentrate on healing. 
? There is a volume of waste from infections and this waste product is very toxic. 
? Often going on something anti-biotic will produce a die off reaction (Herxheimer reaction)—a reaction to endotoxins released by the death of harmful organisms within the body. Charcoal is perfect to help with this.
6.1.8. Slurry water for internal use
* To be taken by babies or those with sensitive digestion.
* Steps:
? Stir 2–3 T. of charcoal powder into a quart of warm water.
? Allow the charcoal to settle out then pour off the gray water into a baby bottle or separate glass.
? This can be repeated several times using the original charcoal.
6.1.9. Toothbrushing
* Video coming soon
6.2  Clay*
6.2.1. Essentials
* Uses (relief within the half hour is not uncommon)
? Food poisoning, stomach ache, fever reduction
? Flu—removes toxins, byproducts of viruses and remains of dead viruses
? Pain associated with virus such as sore throat, earache, toothache, irritated eyes
? Sprains, inflammations, bruises, and even deep tissue pain—areas that are red, painful, swollen, and hot
? Radiation 
* Directions
? DO NOT LET METAL COME IN CONTACT WITH CLAY. This means, for example, use a plastic spoon and put the clay in a glass of water. Wooden spoons and plastic spatulas are also allowed.
? For mixing and storage use a clean, airtight glass or food-grade plastic container
? Filtered water is always best—non-chlorinated, non-fluoridated
? Store mixture out of direct sunlight
* Contraindications—if taking pharmaceutical medications, ingesting clay or charcoal internally can reduce the efficacy of the pharmaceuticals. Topical application does not reduce the efficacy of the pharmaceuticals.
* Types
? Calcuim bentonite clay—for internal and topical use
? ??
* For topical applications 
? A clay pack or hydrated topical application is more effective if you soak the area in clay water first (30–60 minutes is ideal). While soaking, prepare the clay pack or hydrated topical application.
? A clay pack or hydrated topical application must remain moist to be effective. To preserve moisture, cover with plastic and seal with tape.
? Change poultice daily/hourly depending on level of infection (the greater the infection, the more frequently the poultice is changed).
? If applying a clay over the abdomen, do so on an empty stomach
? If someone is unconscious, a paste can be applied to abdomen or elsewhere, then covered to be kept moist. This has the potential to help them wake up.
* For internal use
? Mix one tablespoon of clay with one cup of water
? Shake
? Let sit at least 10 minutes
? Consume
? Sometimes it easier to make up a large batch at once, it won't spoil.
6.2.2. Dry powder applications
* For minor abrasions as well as open, bleeding cuts
* Directions
? Sprinkle some dry powder directly onto the bleeding area—this will speed the clotting process 
? After bleeding as stopped, rinse the cut with cool water and apply a cool poultice.
6.2.3. Soaks and baths
* Be sure to dissolve clay throughly—it will be more effective and it will not clog the bath drain (do not let lumps of clay go down your drain)
* Mix clay by hand with shaking and stirring—or put a ¼ cup in a blender, fill blender with filtered water, blend, add mixture to running bath water.
* See 5.23 Soaks and baths p. 24 
6.2.4. Clay packs
* Mix the dry powder clay into a heavy paste—approximately 1 part clay to 1½ parts water
* Mix until a smooth consistency is obtained.
* Allow to sit for several hours until the water is completely assimilated with the clay. Should the mixture dry out over time, simply add more filtered water to the desired consistency.
* Spread a thick layer of the clay paste onto a piece of cloth or gauze
* Apply to the affected area. If possible, cover with plastic or band-aid, so that clay stays moist.
* Repeat as needed
6.2.5. Hydrated topical applications
* Mix the dry powder clay into a hydrated state—approximately 1 part clay to 3 parts water. Allow to stand a minimum of 12 hours
* Mix thoroughly until a creamy consistency, similar to sour cream. Should the mixture dry out over time, simply add more filtered water to the desired consistency.
* This can be applied topically by hand to any part of the body, from a facial to a full body wrap
6.2.6. Liquid clay for internal use
* Clay requires even more extra water than charcoal.
* Try to take the clay a half hour before food or two hours after food—because it will possibly draw out the good minerals from the food you are trying to get. Taking it a half hour before food is also fine.28
6.3  Colloidal silver*
* Uses
? The world’s most powerful natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent – and very likely works against deadly viral agents, too, as long as it contains tiny, nano-scale sized silver particles.
? Eye and ear infections
? Sore throat
? Spray 6–8 times per day.
? Gargle a few times per day
? Often gone in a day
? Toenail fungus—soak daily for 20 minutes for 4–5 weeks
? Burns, wounds (possibly cuts healing time in half)
? Dandruff (a form of systemic Candida?), head lice
? Skin conditions 
? Anthrax
? Possibly Ebola
* Obtaining the product
? Available at all health food stores. Not all colloidal silvers are created equal. See http://curezone.com/forums/am.asp?i=2026162 Utopia Advanced Colloidal Silver .00065 microns.
? Most economical, make your own. 
? Best generator is http://www.thesilveredge.com/howto.shtml#.U_N7pLuVtpg, specifically designed to produce silver micro-particles as small as .0008 microns. This generator only take 12 gauge silver wire (NOT 10 or 14 gauge)
? Hold out for 9999 silver wire (99.99% pure). The Silver Edge Wire is over-priced and only 99.9% pure.
? Best source of pure silver wire—https://atlasnova.com
* About (from Ingrid Naiman)
? “The issue with colloidal silver is the particulate size. This determines which cells can use the particulates and how.”
? “I have used colloidal silver for years, both internally and externally, but I prefer herbs to silver in most cases, perhaps not all, but most.”
? Purchase the smallest particle size available of ionic silver
* Topically
? From Kimberly Dinsley “We ONLY use the colloidal silver for wounds. Just like charcoal, it anti fungal, anti bacterial, together they are a power horse for an open wound. The charcoal would work alone, but add the colloidal silver and it speeds it up.”
* Internally
? Preventively
? 1 teaspoon–1 oz. of 10 ppm each morning as a daily mineral supplement. 
? To help build immunity
? To prevent or cure infection 
? Acute conditions (colds, flu)
? 4 oz.–12 oz. of 10 ppm a day for a few days to a week. Usually taken in divided doses such as 4 oz. three times per day. 
? A good, high quality colloidal silver solution of about 10 ppm, taken as stated above, will usually clear up a mild to moderate infection in only a few days, while more serious infections may take a little longer.
? With large doses, it is best to include a high quality probiotic about 1 hour after
? Chronic degenerative conditions (such as chronic fatigue syndrome) 
? 16 oz. of 10 ppm a day for 5–10 days. Usually taken in divided doses such as as 5 oz. three times per day. This is known as a loading dose. 
? With large doses, it is best to include a high quality probiotic.
? After 5–10 days, a maintenance does in resumed 
* Add to household cleaning products, hand soaps, toothpaste, etc.
* Sanitize cutting boards and counter-tops
* Use for fungal, viral and bug infestations in the garden. Spray diluted silver on the leaves and add to the soil.
* To purify water, add one tablespoon per gallon, shake well and wait six minutes. 
* Storage
? Use dark brown glass bottles with plastic lids and keep them in a cool dark cabinet. Do not let solution come in contact with plastic lid. 
? Signs it has gone bad
? The general rule of thumb is to watch for precipitation (the silver particles are beginning to fall out of suspension in the solution) in your storage container. The resulting residue will begin to visibly coat the sides or bottom of your storage container. That is the sure sign that your batch of homemade colloidal silver (or even store bought colloidal silver, for that matter) is beginning to lose its potency
? If looking through a colored glass container, a flashlight might be necessary
? Most likely the colloidal silver will be good for over 3 years.

* Coconut water*—contains the electrolytes calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and sodium.
* Bioplasma* (a combination of all 12 cell salts)
* See 9.7 Emergen C p. 88
* Commercial drinks—look for the one with the best ingredients
6.7  Emergen C
* 1,000 mg of vitamin C and other immune supporting antioxidants zinc and manganese, 7 B vitamins to enhance energy naturally, and electrolytes to replenish post-workout!
* For dehydration, an electrolyte mix, good if you are on the road, recommended by Roselee (in her first aid kit)
* Convenient single packets, but most expensive
6.8  Epsom salt*
* A time honored remedy for soreness, swelling and inflammation. Follow the directions on the box for making a soak and soak the injured part at least once a day the first 3 days of the injury and once a day after that. 
* A natural remedy for sore muscles. To soak in epsom salt baths, use 1–2 cups of Epsom salts and dissolve in warm water.
* A natural laxative that works in a pinch. 1 T. in a cup of water. 
6.9  Kitchari* 
* 30Kitchari is very easy to digest, which makes it a wonderful food for resting the digestive tract and allocating extra energy to the body’s natural detoxification processes. Kitchari is considered a nutritionally whole food. It's India's version of chicken noodle soup abd tridoshic.
* See 5.6 Cleanse p. 15 (the white basmati rice and split yellow mung dal make it easy to digest).
* Recipe
? Ingredients
? 1 cup white basmati rice (or quinoa, millet, buckwheat, these are all a better protein source than rice) If cleansing, the important thing is a mono diet.
? ½ cup split mung dal
? 2 T. ghee
? Spices (or 1 Tablespoon Kitchari Spice Mix)
? ¼ t. black mustard seeds
? ½ t. cumin seeds
? ½ t. turmeric powder
? 1½ t. coriander powder
? ½ teaspoon fennel powder 
? 1 pinch hing (asafoetida) 
? 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger 
? 1 t. natural mineral salt 
? 6 cups water 
? 2 cups easily digestible vegetables (such as asparagus, carrots, celery, green beans, summer squash, sweet potato, winter squash, or zucchini) 
* Soak the split mung dal overnight (or for at least 4 hours). 
* Strain the soaking water, combine with the rice and rinse the mixture at least twice, or until the water runs clear, and set aside. 
* In a medium saucepan or soup pot, warm the ghee over medium heat. 
* Add the black mustard seeds, cumin seeds and sauté for a couple of minutes, until the mustard seeds begin to pop. 
* Add the turmeric, coriander, fennel, hing, and fresh ginger (or the kitchari spice mix). 
* Stir briefly, until aromatic. 
* Stir the rice and dal mixture into the spices and sauté for a few moments, stirring constantly.
* Add the 6 cups of water, turn heat to high, and bring to a boil. 
* When the soup comes to a boil, stir in the salt, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 40 minutes. 
* Meanwhile, cut your vegetables into small, bite-sized pieces. About halfway through the kitchari’s cooking process, stir in the vegetables and allow the stew to return to a boil. 
* Continue to simmer until the rice, dal, and vegetables are fully cooked. 
* Remove from heat, cool, and serve. 
* Note: some vegetables, such as sweet potatoes and winter squash, might require more cooking time and may be added earlier, if necessary.
* Aim to have very little water remaining when finished. The consistency should be that of a vegetable stew as opposed to a broth. While you want the beans, rice, and vegetables to be thoroughly cooked, excess water and over-stirring can cause the ingredients to become thick and gummy. 
* Garnish the kitchari with your choice of fresh cilantro, ghee, lemon or lime juice, and salt to taste. Enjoy!
6.10  Golden milk
* A good way to get in more therapeutic amounts of turmeric
6.11  Manuka honey*
* Uses
? Assists natural healing, best used for burns
? Prevents scarring if used as a treatment for a burn or cut
? I’ve seen it heal MSRA. 
? A replacement for Neosporin (what the doctor would put on after stitches are placed or after they are removed or on a cut). Prevents infection
* Apply to the full surface of a clean wound (and just beyond). Often charcoal soaks and poultices are preferable for wounds, especially bad ones.
? Use about 1 T. honey for a 1 ½ inches (5 cm) wound. 
? Don’t skimp
* If you don’t want to apply directly to the wound (for fear of worsening the injury)
? Spread the honey generously and evenly on to a clean dressing pad ensuring there is enough honey for a generous application to the wound surface and any surrounding inflamed tissue.
? Abscesses, cavities and depressions in the bed of the wound are filled with honey before the honey dressed pad is applied to ensure that honey is in contact with the wound bed. 
* Cover if necessary (honey can be messy) 
? Waterproof dressings keep more of the honey in contact with the wound. Absorbent dressings draw the honey away from the wound. 
? Adhesive tape or bandages can be used to hold the dressings in place. 
* Change the dressing at least once a day. Change more frequently (up to three times a day) if the wound is weeping a lot. Weeping decreases as the wound heals, so less frequent dressing changes may be needed later when there could be a few days between changes.
* Possible problems 
? Dressing sticking to the wound indicates that either the dressing needs to be changed more frequently or that not enough honey was used. Be sure to use plenty of honey. 
? Sometimes stinging may be experienced after honey is applied. This is due to the acidity of the honey through which honey stimulates healing. Usually the stinging is short-lived. Discontinue use if the stinging is severe. Some have stopped using the honey for a short while and then found they could use it without severe stinging and to good effect. 
* Internal Uses 
? Heartburn, acid reflux, calming an upset stomach, stomach ulcers, stomach flu (gastroenteritis), IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), diarrhea or other internal complaints
? For optimal results, take the honey three times per day on an empty stomach.

? Helps with gut health, immunity, constipation and diarrhea (including traveler’s diarrhea)
* Consume 
? Miso soup, sauerkraut, kefir and other lacto-fermented foods and drinks
? Raw milk—contains pre-biotics and probiotics
* Consider supplements 
? Bio-Kult—2 capsules, 2–3 times daily
? Progurt 
* Pre-biotics make the probiotics you take more effective.
? Apple cider vinegar
? 1 T. apple cider vinegar in water
? Include as an ingredient in salad dressings
? Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens
? Garlic, onions, leeks
6.15  Quintons*
* Uses: Lack of minerals are the root of many symptoms. Practitioners see a difference in minerals in the body with the use of Quintons. 
* Dosing
? Take 15 minutes before food, swish in mouth for a few minutes, then swallow. 
? Ideally, you would also take organic sulfur 30 minutes before the Quintons to open up the cells to receive the minerals.
* In general Hypertonic is used in the morning or before working out, whereas Isotonic is used before bed. Alternate to get the best of both
* Isotonic 
? Same concentration as your blood, extra cellular
? Healing, sleep, gentle detox
? Take Isotonic, not Hypertonic, if coming down with something. Take 6 a day for 3 days
* Hypertonic
? More concentrated, intracellular
? Gives energy. Athletics take it for performance
? Relieves stress
? Take first thing in the morning. It gives you energy. One a day is fine
6.16  Shea butter*
* Uses
? Sunscreen (equivalent of SPF 6), healing sunburn 
? Pain relief from swelling and arthritis
? Improves muscle relaxation and stiffness
? Skin rash, dry skin, healthy skin, insect bites
6.17  Sport Berkey*
* Portable water filter essentials
? Municipal water: 640 refills
? Raw untreated water: 160 refills 
? Can be used to filter pond, lake and river water (flow is best just below the surface)
? Not intended for use with salt water
* Maintenance
? As the black element filters out particulate from the water, the flow will gradually reduce over time. When this occurs, remove the element and scrub the outer surface with a stiff toothbrush under running water. Do not use cleaning detergents on the filtering element!
? When system is not used regularly, remove element from bottle and allow to air dry in sunny window. Do not store element in airtight bottle.
? Do not subject bottle to extremes in temperature, cold or heat. Don’t store in car.
6.18  Sulfur*
* Essentials
? Uses
? Neither bacteria nor viruses live in oxygen!!!! Sulfur oxygenates! But you have to also be emphatic about increasing water.
? Wound healing
* From “The Power of MSM”: “MSM enhances tissue pliability and encourage the repair of damaged skin. Wound healing occurs more quickly with MSM alone, but the fastest healing occurs when vitamin C is added”
? Radiation (but you still need iodine for thyroid), 
? Vaccination, detoxing, Alzheimer’s, toxic exposures (sulfates out aluminum, mercury, lead) 
? Rejuvenation
? Constipation
? Parasites (makes your terrain slippery and in-hospitable) 
? Improve dreaming (and deep REM sleep). Some people like to take their dose literally right before they go to sleep (as they turn the lights out). Others prefer to take it before 6:00pm (claiming that it keeps them up at night). Others just take it after dinner sometime.
? Improves the health of your cells by carrying oxygen (in the water you drink) to them.
? Mosquitoes and bed bugs
* Sulfur oxygenates the blood, therefore is repugnant to mosquitoes and bed bugs. If someone with blood carrying sulfur is bitten by a mosquito carrying malaria, the high oxygen content of the blood will most likely prevent the virus from replicating. 
* In addition to taking sulfur every 12 hours, it may be necessary to use a topical sulfur mosquito repellent. Dissolve 1 t. sulfur in 4 oz. of hot water and spray on body.
? Use only “organic sulfur” in crystal form (purity test is if it will grow more crystals after being dissolved in water). Quality organic sulfur sold by Patrick McGean and others. Do not use MSM, which is not nearly as effective. 
? Five days are needed to begin the internal sulfur cycle.
* Dosing
? Dose is by weight—For every 100 pounds, take 1 t. 2 times per day. 
? Sulfur is in the body for 12 hours, then must be replenished. 
? Can be taken with food, but not with fluoridated or chlorinated water, anti-caking agents or anything unnatural (processed food, supplements, etc.). 
? It will not work using chlorinated water (chlorine blocks the uptake of sulfur). Use filtered water. Also, needs the body to be hydrated with water to work. Sulfur carries the oxygen from the water to cells. To determine amount of water for daily consumption: take body weight and divide by two. Drink that amount in ounces each day, particularly during daylight hours.
? Ideally take half hour before something of consequence (such as supplements, or anything you want to potentiate). The sulfur has to get into the lymph and circulate. 
* If you wish to know the pH of your internal terrain test your tears, blink you eyes to moisten your lower lid and touch the tear with a pH strip, which will give you a reading of the pH of your terrain, your lymph, your spinal fluid. Urine and saliva have already been acidified. Sulfur raises the pH of water to 31

? Fights infections
* Works when taken with or without food; however, people report more immediate and obvious benefits when taken (mixed with a liquid) on an empty stomach. You can eat solid foods immediately after as the liquid will go straight to your small intestine (to be absorbed in your blood stream)
* 32We have shown that this long half-life
applies only to very low doses. By contrast, the half-life for high blood levels is only half an hour. This short half-life means that for high dose vitamin C the period between doses needs to be short—a few hours at most.
* To have a reasonable chance of avoiding a major viral infection, a daily intake of at least 10 grams of ascorbic acid is needed. The idea
is to start low, taking say 500–1,000 mg four times a day. Build up the intake to close to bowel tolerance; increased wind and large soft stools will occur before diarrhea signals that bowel tolerance has been exceeded. At this stage, back off the dose a little, to a reasonably
comfortable level.
* To get rid of a common cold, you may need anything from 20–60 grams (60,000 mg) a day. With influenza the need might be for 100
grams (100,000 mg) a day. Since it varies from person to person, and from illness to illness, the only way to find out is to experiment for
yourself.
* At the first hint of an infection—feeling unwell, itchy throat, fatigue, and so on—take more ascorbic acid. If the hint of impending sickness is mild, take perhaps 5 grams every half hour or even more frequently.
* Anything more than a hint of infection, take as large a dose as you feel could be tolerated and follow this by taking 5 grams every half hour. The rule is to take as much as you can without going over the tolerated level: you will probably be taking too little, even though you
are trying hard to take a massive dose.
* Sugar interferes with the uptake of vitamin C. If you are using vitamin C to combat a viral infection do not eat any sugar or carbohydrates
(long chain sugars) or the vitamin C will not be absorbed properly. We stress that this means no sugar and no carbs, at all.
* Liposomal vitamin C is NOT more effective than IV for fighting acute infections. We prefer liposomes for chronic infections and cancer, but this does not extend to acute illness. http://truthfarmer.com
* Sources
? Good—Rose hip tea, Emergen C—see 9.7 Emergen C p. 88
? Better—Acerola
? Natural complete whole food high dose vitamin C (much better than simple ascorbic acid, which is probably GMO). A super food according to Sally Fallon
1.1.3. Vitamin C pills
* 33What you’ll need… 
? 1 tablespoon rose hip powder 
? 1 tablespoon amla powder 
? 1 tablespoon acerola powder 
? Honey 
? Orange peel powder (optional) 
* Mix together the powdered herbs, breaking up any clumps. Pour slightly warmed honey into the powdered mix. I never measure how much honey I use. Just pour a tiny bit, stir, add a bit more, stir. You want the final consistently to hold together but not be too moist or sticky. Once the powders are mixed with the honey, form the mixture into pea sized balls. These can then be rolled in orange powder or another one of the powders in the mixture. 
* Makes 45 pea sized pills
* Take 1–3 pills daily. It’s safe to take more than three pills a day; the adverse effect from getting too much vitamin C is loose stools. If you get loose stools then stop using them for the day and use less in the future.
* Vitamin C shouldn’t be taken in excess during pregnancy.
1.1.4. Vitamin D
* Sunshine is always best
* Be careful, balance is more important than quantity if taking a supplement. Vitamin D needs to be in balance with vitamin A and vitamin K
1.1.5. Multivitamins
* Thorne, MediClear Plus
* Quantum Max Stress B— http://radiantlightnutrition.com/item.asp?PID=1211
* See Pure Encapsulations (food club options at ½ off retail)— http://www.foodclub.org/w/images/Orderfrm_prof.pdf
1.2  Willard water
* Known for burns and it's episode on 60 Minutes
* Helps ailments similar to colloidal silver
* The two can be combined together for a very beneficial effect
